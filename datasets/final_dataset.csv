been using it since an year no problem at all can run any current aaa game can handle multi tasking mid to not very high level gaming with no problems if u have other good combination of components integrated,been using it since an year no problem at all can run any current aaa game can handle multi tasking mid to not very high level gaming with no problems if u have other good combination of components integrated
caution  price k is overprice now please buy it under k only otherwise check some other applicationssites for better price,caution  price k is overprice now please buy it under k only otherwise check some other applicationssites for better price
the cpu is overall great for everything itll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming if you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy but the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler first of all i would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnt and also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting also the performance is not nice many would say stock cooler is more than enough for f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched  degrees so i took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going  to degrees and it was approx the same case while gaming idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling so be careful with the stock cooler or i would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like india where it gets to  degrees easily and you dont have an ac in your room aio is the choice,the cpu is overall great for everything itll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming if you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy but the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler first of all i would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnt and also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting also the performance is not nice many would say stock cooler is more than enough for f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched  degrees so i took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going  to degrees and it was approx the same case while gaming idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling so be careful with the stock cooler or i would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like india where it gets to  degrees easily and you dont have an ac in your room aio is the choice

it is a good processor to build a low budget computer in this processor you have to install a separate graphic card for the display i would also say that installing a cooler or a liquid cooler is also very important because this processor heats up more,it is a good processor to build a low budget computer in this processor you have to install a separate graphic card for the display i would also say that installing a cooler or a liquid cooler is also very important because this processor heats up more

ive owned more expensive cpus  up to amd ryzen  and intel k in most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages most of the work i was doing offloaded everything to my gpu so having a beastly cpu was a wasteive downgraded to this cpu in my main desktop rig its great for productivity software music and design work as well as gaming i have it paired with a rtx  series card and havent noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming maybe  fps in most games i max out the monitors hzfps at pone different thing about this cpu over other intel offerings is that it has  performance cores with  threads  hyperthreading and no low powered efficiency cores they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery powerthe cpu is also very efficient and runs quite cool mine is c when idle and  light tasks such as browsing the web during gaming  the temps are usually in the mid s benchmarking such as cinebench and geekbench etc reaches mid s i am using a twofan deepcool as plus air cooler with three case mm fansall in all  very happy with purchase and highly recommend,ive owned more expensive cpus  up to amd ryzen  and intel k in most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages most of the work i was doing offloaded everything to my gpu so having a beastly cpu was a wasteive downgraded to this cpu in my main desktop rig its great for productivity software music and design work as well as gaming i have it paired with a rtx  series card and havent noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming maybe  fps in most games i max out the monitors hzfps at pone different thing about this cpu over other intel offerings is that it has  performance cores with  threads  hyperthreading and no low powered efficiency cores they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery powerthe cpu is also very efficient and runs quite cool mine is c when idle and  light tasks such as browsing the web during gaming  the temps are usually in the mid s benchmarking such as cinebench and geekbench etc reaches mid s i am using a twofan deepcool as plus air cooler with three case mm fansall in all  very happy with purchase and highly recommend

as it should be instead of buying laptops and preassembled laptops a real nerd builds a computer himself and in addition to this he shares his experience in the ancient art of pc building also with friends and relatives my brother needed to use a computer and imagining the sadness of seeing him with a laptop a preassembled one or even worse with a mac i decided to build him a custommade computer and anyway what better way to convert someone to pc gaming than with a computer assembled with a lot of brotherly love so i decided to choose this processor because since it is a build primarily for school use  gaming and with a relatively limited budget ok brotherly love and everything but lets not exaggerate it seemed to me the best compromise between performance and quality in the end the seller sent me the f but i wanted the  so i made the return and i bought the  which in any case is identical apart from the integrated gpu and slightly higher frequencies so i can review it anyway since they are essentially the same processor it is a core thread processor which does not have the elusive ecores of the most expensive series for example the  has pcores like this plus ecores that help with background operations especially if you use windows  at a frequency of  ghz with a boost of up to  ghz if temperatures workload and your motherboard allow it a processor of this type excels in gaming but it doesnt suck even in the most complicated operations in fact this processor also performs very well in video editing with adobe premiere i combined it with a gigabyte rtx g and gb of ddr at mhz all on an asus bma prime performance and temperatures as i said before it is a midrange processor particularly suitable for gaming but which manages even the most professional operations without a hitch the architecture of these twelfthgeneration intel processors after a fairly disappointing eleventh generation is excellent without giving the numbers with benchmarks and other incomprehensible things i can tell you that in gaming it behaves at the same level as the good old ryzen  x undoubtedly the best midrange processor along with this one i dont think youll have problems with gaming or productivity using this processor provided the rest of the hardware is up to par i use it with trivial ddr at mhz so in terms of performance we are similar to the x i had on my build last year but if you combine it with a bit serious ddr it can certainly exceed it even if by a little bit in any case it performs very well in gaming especially when combined with a somewhat serious gpu like my rtx i havent noticed bottlenecks especially in the case of this build which will be used with a only p monitor as for temperatures this is a fairly quiet cpu with a tdp of only w at the moment i dont have a sink because it hasnt arrived so im using the stock sink included in the package i expected it would suck but its definitely acceptable temperatures do not exceed c in gaming even with heavy games while making the most of it with a cinebench it does not exceed c which is acceptable and well below the c throttling threshold even the sound of the original fan is quite low so well maybe ill keep it with the stock sink certainly however my case an nzxt with  additional fans helps a lot besides this i didnt trust the veil of preapplied thermal paste and i put my trusty gelid gc extreme in it because for a w processor with the dissi stock you certainly need an extreme level of thermal paste f version or not f tray or box integrated gpu the difference between the two versions lies in the availability of the integrated gpu the f version does not include it and it generally costs a little less depending on the difference in price consider whether to take one or the other i am not a fan of intel integrated gpus and i always try whenever possible to combine a dedicated gpu even if very scarce in this case i have the rtx which is a good gaming card so why did i want to get the processor with the integrated gpu because with certain programs that support intel quicksync technology the integrated gpu is not there to sleep but is actively used for video encoding or for other operations such as the timeline in premiere the little brother uses adobe premiere which can take advantage of this technology but other video editing or streaming programs also use it such as obs studio which can use the video encoder of the integrated gpu to trim leaving the dedicated gpu free for the game in any case the integrated gpu is the usual intel uhd on the  it is the uhd  on the  the  i havent tested it much in gaming but anyway dont expect who knows what the power of this is similar to the entry levels dedicated to laptops from a few years ago such as the m or so so its good for light games in any case it has no problems whatsoever when it comes to viewing videos or d images that are not particularly complex it can handle k videos on youtube or retro games and various emulators without problems as for other cryptic nomenclatures sometimes we see tray or box the difference between the two is the presence of a sink in the box version as i said above the cooler is poor but for a cpu like this it is sufficient if on the other hand you dont need it take the tray version should i take the   or  in my opinion among these three the best is the  and ill also explain why the  and the  are brothers while the  is in effect the superior model lets start with the  this processor has the same base as the  but with slightly higher base and boost frequencies as well as a slightly more powerful integrated gpu namely the intel uhd  against the  of the  higher frequencies essentially translate into a static improvement of an average of  more or less depending on the workload but practically never above  the integrated gpu is a little more powerful but it is always a very poor integrated one that is not suitable for gaming regardless if the price difference were about ten euros it could even be there but honestly i cant think of any reason why the  deserves to exist at almost  more avoid it i bought it only because i needed it in a hurry and the seller made a mistake in sending me the f instead of the  otherwise i would never have bought it the  on the other hand is on another playing field and is in effect the superior model as i said at the beginning in addition to the  pcores the  has  ecores as well as higher frequencies and the k version if you want to overclock for the price of almost  above  it could even fit you if its within your budget and you do intense multitasking or a lot of rendering operations in gaming they are practically the same the difference between the two can be perceived at high frame rates and low resolutions in aaa games perhaps in k you will be limited by the gpu in most cases in any case if you want to assemble a pc with a higher budget than mine and perhaps combined with a more powerful gpu than my  it could be worth it even if only because of the presence of ecores however i believe that the  is the sweet spot to consider for any midrange pc possibly considering an upgrade in a few years to the xxx generation when prices fall conclusion what can i say the  is a respectable cpu at a very affordable price among other things it is excellent in a midrange gaming build combined with a somewhat serious gpu and it doesnt work even in professional graphics programs used at an amateur or school level im definitely not telling you anything new but i fully recommend it for midrange builds and a

 processor delivery was made after  day the best processor you can buy in the price range in my opinion ive been using it for  months and im very satisfied the included cooler is also okay it cools the processor sufficiently but not necessarily quietd  then i would rather recommend a good cpu cooler as it doesnt cost much,processor delivery was made after  day the best processor you can buy in the price range in my opinion ive been using it for  months and im very satisfied the included cooler is also okay it cools the processor sufficiently but not necessarily quietd  then i would rather recommend a good cpu cooler as it doesnt cost much

if you want to build a cheap build this is a good processor especially when it is at a prime discount i recommend replacing the stock cooler with something more valid and quieter but if you are really tight on a budget the stock is also fine it can still have its say in  especially when paired with a good video card eg rx  and a decent motherboard,if you want to build a cheap build this is a good processor especially when it is at a prime discount i recommend replacing the stock cooler with something more valid and quieter but if you are really tight on a budget the stock is also fine it can still have its say in  especially when paired with a good video card eg rx  and a decent motherboard

atried a couple of weeks combined with an rtx  on some online games i think its a really great processor its coming down in price or with various offers its between  and  euros and at this price i dont think you could ask for better the only drawback it will be the new architecture it will be the bios of the motherboards but the turbo core does not go to  ghz on all the cores at the same time as it was on the previous xxx xxx series or on x or x platforms the famous enhanced turbo boost option is not implemented here but it stops at  gigahertz however i dont think it could change that much in gaming given several comparative videos even with i and i of the same series and the fps are practically the same which leaves a lot of questions about whether or not to spend  times as much to get little or nothing more always remaining in the gaming field processors with more threads will certainly make a difference in productivity,atried a couple of weeks combined with an rtx  on some online games i think its a really great processor its coming down in price or with various offers its between  and  euros and at this price i dont think you could ask for better the only drawback it will be the new architecture it will be the bios of the motherboards but the turbo core does not go to  ghz on all the cores at the same time as it was on the previous xxx xxx series or on x or x platforms the famous enhanced turbo boost option is not implemented here but it stops at  gigahertz however i dont think it could change that much in gaming given several comparative videos even with i and i of the same series and the fps are practically the same which leaves a lot of questions about whether or not to spend  times as much to get little or nothing more always remaining in the gaming field processors with more threads will certainly make a difference in productivity

its very fast but it heats up a lot it even uses w in a stress test before buying try to find out on the forums about this issue no matter what cooler and thermal paste you use it will get very hot the only solution is to make a slight undervolt or lower the loadline calibration in the bios it reminded me of the ik that suffered from the same problem,its very fast but it heats up a lot it even uses w in a stress test before buying try to find out on the forums about this issue no matter what cooler and thermal paste you use it will get very hot the only solution is to make a slight undervolt or lower the loadline calibration in the bios it reminded me of the ik that suffered from the same problem
 with intel its very good the performance is just incredible with the native boost i managed to oc up to ghz and im sure that we can go up again with a custom water the only flaw is that very quickly when you take a  he sticks his tongue out a bit in k i will have to change it after  years because of bottleneck but on a configuration with a  ti it must be a very good synergy very good on processor tasks too to use it to do a bit of rendering the performance is really good,with intel its very good the performance is just incredible with the native boost i managed to oc up to ghz and im sure that we can go up again with a custom water the only flaw is that very quickly when you take a  he sticks his tongue out a bit in k i will have to change it after  years because of bottleneck but on a configuration with a  ti it must be a very good synergy very good on processor tasks too to use it to do a bit of rendering the performance is really good

i upgraded to this cpu after some heavy research asking reddit both intel and amd subreddits weighing in money vs performance gained i have used amd since i was a teen and started building computers the conclusion is this it is an amazing cpu runs faster and cooler than my ryzen   the price and performance vs amd also including a board was better than if i had went with a ryzen  xsome background information i wanted to upgrade after receiving an amazon gift card i have never ordered computer parts from amazon though i upgraded from a ryzen   with an asus xf board i really wanted to upgrade and was sad also that windows  did not support my cpu i will give it to microsoft for this as it made a lot of people upgrade their entire computers all for basically the same os as of now with newer looks and not much done under the hood except for th gen intel so good news there too sadly my old board still doesnt support the ryzen   series and only the  series they are working on a bios apparently for the  series because of people who were in my shoes i first almost ordered the ryzen  xt for  after a couple hours of research asking and thinking about it i cancelled that order thankfully and thought well if i am going to spend this much on upgrading my cpu i might as well go all inspend a little more for something better as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile i was then going to get the ryzen  x with an asus board there lied a problem of price i could not find a board and get that cpu still within my budget atleast not a board that wasnt worse than the one i had in ways i mentioned i had posted on the amd subreddit and even they suggested i go intel intel is just killing it as of now hands down although i am sure amd will retaliate i ended up getting the msi za ddr i wish i had the money for ddr ram i would have went with the ddr version as it was basically the same price i had a lot of second thoughts on this board though as it just didnt seem premium as the one i had i am going to do a whole review on it after this ill save my pros  cons for there this cpu also autoclocks itself up or down depending on the load saw it clock down to ghz although not for long for example if not much processing power is warranted which makes sense and i wish everything did so if idling it will clock down and save powerheatand therefore longevity is increased i absolutely love this cpu coming from amd anywaysif you have a corsair hi rgb platinum or similar cooler already the included  screws work just fine with the  socket and this cpu even though you are supposed to get the  kitscrews for this cpu which i did but they are taking forever to ship so i googled and someone said using the  screws will work just fine i get better temps than my ryzen   i can even overclock even more but have no need and no pointtldrupgraded from ryzen   asus rog strix xf gamingupgraded to ik msi za ddrparts kept xgb gb ddr cl mhz ram with xmp docp rtx  the ram works great with this cpu as well although it technically latency wise runs at t on intel instead of t on amd runs slower than when on amd amds infinity fabric but obviously whatever intel is doing makes up for that and therefore my ram either runs fasterthe samepros it is an amazing cpu for price vs performance the ik is good as well i almost just went with it and you would be fine going with it for gaming as even it still has more cores technically than the ryzen  x it also beats the x even though this cpu is supposed to be its comparison rival brother this cpu has cool temps on my corsair hi rgb platinum cooler and the pe core structure are really cool and fun to watch when doing tasksgaming it shipped fastcons literally none with the cpu itself just with shipping  it shipped really fast was here in  days after purchasing on here the biggest complaint i have is amazons shipping so be aware of this i have never ordered computer parts from amazon and have always used newegg they just left the cpu in my mailbox and if it werent for me looking at my cameras and looking out for this part it would have sat in the mailbox all day my mailbox sadly is not very weather proof as well and if it had been raining it wouldnt have been good although it did come in a big box around it the cpu also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box not held into the front windowi hope

this is my first intel build coming from past amd builds ryzen fx athlon phenom i am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this cpu with instructions followed this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least  i overclocked this via the motherboardbios settings and it stays cool with a  fan cooler dont get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate windows experience rating is a  so that says it all if you have the extra  go with the i i should have done that amd seems to be all the hype but i see why intel wont be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip,this is my first intel build coming from past amd builds ryzen fx athlon phenom i am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this cpu with instructions followed this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least  i overclocked this via the motherboardbios settings and it stays cool with a  fan cooler dont get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate windows experience rating is a  so that says it all if you have the extra  go with the i i should have done that amd seems to be all the hype but i see why intel wont be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip

 a big step forward from intel the processor is really good park in consumption powerful in both single and multicore and does not heat excessively if youre looking at it here youve probably already seen countless benchmarks on the web so its useless to post them like all the components of a pc it must be contextualized with respect to the use that a person has to make of it personally i recommend buying,a big step forward from intel the processor is really good park in consumption powerful in both single and multicore and does not heat excessively if youre looking at it here youve probably already seen countless benchmarks on the web so its useless to post them like all the components of a pc it must be contextualized with respect to the use that a person has to make of it personally i recommend buying

the one i bought one year ago had instability didnt know it was the cpu until it really started acting up had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the cpu when i reached out to intel they informed me about a policy about tray processor and boxed processor basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they dont cover warranty as for boxed processor they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more fortunatly the one i got was a boxed one but still intel told me i had a tray processor i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a box processor it was a bit unnerving but at the en they offered me the warranty and im supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them,the one i bought one year ago had instability didnt know it was the cpu until it really started acting up had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the cpu when i reached out to intel they informed me about a policy about tray processor and boxed processor basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they dont cover warranty as for boxed processor they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more fortunatly the one i got was a boxed one but still intel told me i had a tray processor i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a box processor it was a bit unnerving but at the en they offered me the warranty and im supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them

compared to the coffee lake generation i had been willingly stuck on for  years this is a massive leap before buying i was a bit skeptical since im not a fan of intels newer way of handling cores but the first thing i tried when i got it was emulating ps games and right off the bat i saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubledthe older cpus from the th th and th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if youre on a budget maybe look on the used market for those but if you really need something powerful this is a good option,compared to the coffee lake generation i had been willingly stuck on for  years this is a massive leap before buying i was a bit skeptical since im not a fan of intels newer way of handling cores but the first thing i tried when i got it was emulating ps games and right off the bat i saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubledthe older cpus from the th th and th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if youre on a budget maybe look on the used market for those but if you really need something powerful this is a good option

the morning after building and setting up windows drivers etc the pc had blue screened because of temperatures and after a reset and entering the bios i saw that the temperature was  degrees celsius thankfully after some trial and error i was able to undervolt it and not have my cpu die id suggest anyone who looks into getting an intel cpu to undervolt it,the morning after building and setting up windows drivers etc the pc had blue screened because of temperatures and after a reset and entering the bios i saw that the temperature was  degrees celsius thankfully after some trial and error i was able to undervolt it and not have my cpu die id suggest anyone who looks into getting an intel cpu to undervolt it

its pretty good value for money as far as intel cpus are concerned for a th gen cpu but if youre looking for the better value get the ik which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a th gen cpu the only real downside of the k is that it generally requires a th gen compatible motherboard otherwise youll need to flash the bios on a th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read th gen cpu i highly do not recommend doing this ive tried it a few and its such a big hassle many potential issuesthat i recommend first time pc builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a th gen cpu along with a th gen compatible motherboard dont buy th gen mobo which obviously doesnt require flashing bios for the k to be usable,its pretty good value for money as far as intel cpus are concerned for a th gen cpu but if youre looking for the better value get the ik which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a th gen cpu the only real downside of the k is that it generally requires a th gen compatible motherboard otherwise youll need to flash the bios on a th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read th gen cpu i highly do not recommend doing this ive tried it a few and its such a big hassle many potential issuesthat i recommend first time pc builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a th gen cpu along with a th gen compatible motherboard dont buy th gen mobo which obviously doesnt require flashing bios for the k to be usable

this is my first upgrade since the ik this processor is a beast eats away at any task i throw at it without a sweat i was a little hesitant with the new cpu designs with the performance and efficiency cores but man the efficiency cores alone kill my k  great cpu just make sure you know these shoot to the sky heat wise when you punch heavy workloads and you will need cooling to match depending of how long and how much you will need to pull away from it,this is my first upgrade since the ik this processor is a beast eats away at any task i throw at it without a sweat i was a little hesitant with the new cpu designs with the performance and efficiency cores but man the efficiency cores alone kill my k  great cpu just make sure you know these shoot to the sky heat wise when you punch heavy workloads and you will need cooling to match depending of how long and how much you will need to pull away from it

ikit was originally a replacement from the th generation ik performance has been greatly improved im very satisfied  a lot of streaming software etc have been started at the same time but so far there is no such thing as insufficient processing performance however its easy to hold the heat i dont know if air cooling can cool it down i use simple water cooling fyi,ikit was originally a replacement from the th generation ik performance has been greatly improved im very satisfied  a lot of streaming software etc have been started at the same time but so far there is no such thing as insufficient processing performance however its easy to hold the heat i dont know if air cooling can cool it down i use simple water cooling fyi
i was worried about the top model core ik but i chose this core ik which has the same specs as the number of cores and improved peak performance and watt performance it is operated with a z motherboard but if the bios is compatible there is no particular problem since recent motherboards only need a power supply to update the bios there are many cases where there is no problem even if the bios is not compatible we recommend that you update your device drivers to the latest or download if you are installing a new one beforehand the score of cinebenchr is  in multi and  in single the score has increased by about  from the core ik and the power consumption during full load is about w lower so its a nice feeling compared to nm and current products from other companies i think they are doing well with process rules that are  to  generations down but i think that the evaluation is divided without changing from alder lake that a mm simple watercooled cooler is essential performance per watt at full load is honestly quite subtle the one i installed this time is for a gaming pc so im personally very satisfied because it doesnt let me encode videos if it is the main encoding process i recommend the ryzen  x which is an old model that works without problems with a large air cooled cooler but is easy to handle and is cheaper if youre a game main i recommend the core ik which has high singlethread performance because it has high watt performance and cost performance,i was worried about the top model core ik but i chose this core ik which has the same specs as the number of cores and improved peak performance and watt performance it is operated with a z motherboard but if the bios is compatible there is no particular problem since recent motherboards only need a power supply to update the bios there are many cases where there is no problem even if the bios is not compatible we recommend that you update your device drivers to the latest or download if you are installing a new one beforehand the score of cinebenchr is  in multi and  in single the score has increased by about  from the core ik and the power consumption during full load is about w lower so its a nice feeling compared to nm and current products from other companies i think they are doing well with process rules that are  to  generations down but i think that the evaluation is divided without changing from alder lake that a mm simple watercooled cooler is essential performance per watt at full load is honestly quite subtle the one i installed this time is for a gaming pc so im personally very satisfied because it doesnt let me encode videos if it is the main encoding process i recommend the ryzen  x which is an old model that works without problems with a large air cooled cooler but is easy to handle and is cheaper if youre a game main i recommend the core ik which has high singlethread performance because it has high watt performance and cost performance

as soon as it was assembled it became a blue screen due to thermal runaway and in order to pursue current certification there was no improvement at all and as a result of replacing it with the i kf i bought at the same time the cpu was discovered to be the cause and there is no way you can tell right after it arrives and this warranty period is too short and the cpu is cheap          its not there so the replacement is  still a long way off and the days of putting up with it for a while with only a limited number of games that can be made are the worst,as soon as it was assembled it became a blue screen due to thermal runaway and in order to pursue current certification there was no improvement at all and as a result of replacing it with the i kf i bought at the same time the cpu was discovered to be the cause and there is no way you can tell right after it arrives and this warranty period is too short and the cpu is cheap          its not there so the replacement is  still a long way off and the days of putting up with it for a while with only a limited number of games that can be made are the worst

after too many years of gaming on an old ik i finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year  i purchased the most up to date cpu and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did overall i think this is a great cpu however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things intel just keeps pushing these cpus harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of amd but in the process they are making cpus that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool after a lot of tweaking in the bios i finally got this one to stay below the  degree celsius threshold but that doesnt account for how hot it still makes my room when im gaming the extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months but as summer is approaching im wondering how this is going to pan outanyway the cpu is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box i didnt run into any errors or issues with this cpu overall i  recommend it because intel has never let me down ive been building my own systems for more than  years now too so thats a pretty long track record of cpus that just worked and never died because of that i can easily recommend this cpu and i would definitely order it again,after too many years of gaming on an old ik i finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year  i purchased the most up to date cpu and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did overall i think this is a great cpu however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things intel just keeps pushing these cpus harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of amd but in the process they are making cpus that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool after a lot of tweaking in the bios i finally got this one to stay below the  degree celsius threshold but that doesnt account for how hot it still makes my room when im gaming the extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months but as summer is approaching im wondering how this is going to pan outanyway the cpu is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box i didnt run into any errors or issues with this cpu overall i  recommend it because intel has never let me down ive been building my own systems for more than  years now too so thats a pretty long track record of cpus that just worked and never died because of that i can easily recommend this cpu and i would definitely order it again

"My last I3 was the gen 9, so jumping to 12 and seeing that its a PINLESS CPU (pins are on the motherboard) was a big surprise and a bit of a relief. Overall I am damned happy with the upgrade, its not a top end gaming PC but its more than enough. I don't do competitive FPS games, RTX lighting is obnoxious as well as motion blur - basically purty graphics and good performance is what matters.That said the one complaint I do have falls on Amazon. You'd think that a processor would be packaged in a box with some protective wrapping right? Nope. Paper bag with no bubble wrap that also arrived torn. The fact that the RAM didn't fall out the hole and that the CPU works fine is a relief.",my last i3 was the gen 9 so jumping to 12 and seeing that its a pinless cpu pins are on the motherboard was a big surprise and a bit of a relief overall i am damned happy with the upgrade its not a top end gaming pc but its more than enough i dont do competitive fps games rtx lighting is obnoxious as well as motion blur  basically purty graphics and good performance is what mattersthat said the one complaint i do have falls on amazon youd think that a processor would be packaged in a box with some protective wrapping right nope paper bag with no bubble wrap that also arrived torn the fact that the ram didnt fall out the hole and that the cpu works fine is a relief

The price this little quad core comes in at really is incredible. Sure it's quad core but this is not the i3 of the past (well kinda is but you know what I mean). 4.3ghz single core with 8 threads means this think is a mini gaming beast. It can do 1440p gaming (with capable card of course) and I have been doing just that. The only reason I will be moving on from it is for the 6 core i3 in 14th gen. Best believe though I will be making another inexpensive PC with this when I upgrade. I have a spare 5500xt that should make for a quality 1080p second machine for when I visit home to my mom's. 5/5 stars.,the price this little quad core comes in at really is incredible sure its quad core but this is not the i3 of the past well kinda is but you know what i mean 43ghz single core with 8 threads means this think is a mini gaming beast it can do 1440p gaming with capable card of course and i have been doing just that the only reason i will be moving on from it is for the 6 core i3 in 14th gen best believe though i will be making another inexpensive pc with this when i upgrade i have a spare 5500xt that should make for a quality 1080p second machine for when i visit home to my moms 55 stars

"Hello,So I bought this processor to replace my ryzen 7 2700x that finally decided to die on me. I have had the ryzen since launch.I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender.

"So I was stuck on Windows 10 with my LGA 1151 core i7-6700.  This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.  I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back.  My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization.  At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%.  All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11.  Will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good GPU.",so i was stuck on windows 10 with my lga 1151 core i76700  this processor at an affordable price more than doubled maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older ddr4 3200 ram and m2 storage  also allows me to update my machine to windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu  i considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new matx board and this cpu  the only complaint i have is the cpu box was clearly opened and i am left wondering if this was dropped into someone elses board at some point and returned  i dont like that when the product is being advertised as new  the seller was amazon llc too so i am not sure what is going on with that  i have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so i really dont want to pack it up and ship it back  my chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71c but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100 utilization  at idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 3035c with the fan running somewhere around 40  all in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for win 11  will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good gpu

I was having issues with a new build where I wasn't able to adjust any of my fan speeds. The included fan was not spinning faster than about 600 RPM and luckily the processor throttled itself at 100C to prevent death. After taking the fan off and powering it separately it spun up to 3000RPM. I noticed that the wires were pinched along the heatsink because the housing was screwed down too tight. It happens. After fixing it and screwing it back on (not as tight) everything seems to be working. If the CPU wasn't throttling it would have died because of a tiny mistake in the fan wiring go figure.,i was having issues with a new build where i wasnt able to adjust any of my fan speeds the included fan was not spinning faster than about 600 rpm and luckily the processor throttled itself at 100c to prevent death after taking the fan off and powering it separately it spun up to 3000rpm i noticed that the wires were pinched along the heatsink because the housing was screwed down too tight it happens after fixing it and screwing it back on not as tight everything seems to be working if the cpu wasnt throttling it would have died because of a tiny mistake in the fan wiring go figure

"Upgrading from i5 6600. My new i3 is so cute im going to nickname it AWESOME! The cooler is very elegant. I hope it works! Thanks! Amazon for fast shipping arriving a day early and packaged nice!I was really excited about the cooler but the mounting mechanism is aweful. It dont clip dont nice now matter how hard i tried. Theres always one last clip just loose. I can reach on the backside and pop it off easily with my finger. I can understand people on a budget and needs to rely on this cooler and intel provides, Thanks! but i switched over to a cheap waterblock and i felt way more at ease.Intel skimped on the thermal paste. upon first installation i tried a game and it throttled my cpu with turbo boost on. I took the cooler off to try another cooler and looked at the paste it barely cover the cpu.I added more paste on top of intel paste and got a 15c drop and no more throttle. If you dont have better cooling solution i advise you get more thermal paste for sure.I test CPU on game COD MW3 before with intel 6600 i get 35-50fps with a lot of micro stutter.now with new intel i3 its getting 80-120fps smooth. and the fps counter saying its only using about 10-15 % cpu activity! im very happy.

"The cpu is overall great for everything, itâll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnât. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you donât have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.",the cpu is overall great for everything itll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming if you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy but the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler first of all i would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnt and also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting also the performance is not nice many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so i took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95degrees and it was approx the same case while gaming idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling so be careful with the stock cooler or i would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like india where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you dont have an ac in your room aio is the choice

I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :),ive owned more expensive cpus  up to amd ryzen 9 and intel 13900k in most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages most of the work i was doing offloaded everything to my gpu so having a beastly cpu was a wasteive downgraded to this cpu in my main desktop rig its great for productivity software music and design work as well as gaming i have it paired with a rtx 4000 series card and havent noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming maybe 15 fps in most games i max out the monitors 144hzfps at 1440pone different thing about this cpu over other intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores with 12 threads  hyperthreading and no low powered efficiency cores they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery powerthe cpu is also very efficient and runs quite cool mine is 26c when idle and 2630 light tasks such as browsing the web during gaming  the temps are usually in the mid 50s benchmarking such as cinebench and geekbench etc reaches mid 60s i am using a twofan deepcool as500 plus air cooler with three case 120mm fansall in all  very happy with purchase and highly recommend

"INTROCome Ã¨ giusto che sia, anzichÃ© comprare portatilini e preassemblati, un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo, e oltre a questo, condivide la sua esperienza nell'antica arte del PC Building anche con amici e parenti. Mio fratello aveva necessitÃ  di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perchÃ© trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualitÃ . Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque Ã¨ identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino piÃ¹ alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie piÃ¹ costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo piÃ¹ 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni piÃ¹ complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.L'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURECome dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni piÃ¹ ""professionali"". L'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, Ã¨ eccellente.Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttivitÃ  utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell'hardware sia all'altezza.Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po' serie puÃ² sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarÃ  usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perchÃ© non mi Ã¨ arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece Ã¨ decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che Ã¨ accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale Ã¨ abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perchÃ© per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente Ã¨ necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilitÃ  della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che Ã¨ una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perchÃ© ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? PerchÃ© con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lÃ¬ a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che puÃ² sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che puÃ² sfruttare l'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata Ã¨ la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 Ã¨ la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissÃ  cosa. La potenza di questa Ã¨ simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giÃ¹ di lÃ¬, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due Ã¨ la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore Ã¨ scarso ma per una CPU come questa Ã¨ sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore Ã¨ il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perchÃ©.Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 Ã¨ a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco piÃ¹ alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente piÃ¹ potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze piÃ¹ alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di piÃ¹ o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata Ã¨ di poco piÃ¹ potente, ma si tratta sempre di un'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100â¬ in piÃ¹. Evitatelo. Io l'ho comprato solo perchÃ© mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anzichÃ© il 12400. Altrimenti non l'avrei mai comprato.Il 12600 invece Ã¨ su un altro campo da gioco, ed Ã¨ a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze piÃ¹ alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150â¬ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget piÃ¹ alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU piÃ¹ potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.CONCLUSIONEChe dire, il 12400 Ã¨ una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l'altro. Ã eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto.|",introcome  giusto che sia anzich comprare portatilini e

"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money.

"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.",i was using a 10700k i decided it was timewell actually i got the itchi decided to go with the 14700k for a few reasons one is that its the only 14th gen part from intel that got a significant upgrade four more ecores and 8 more threads plus a small clock boosti also dont like that the 3dfx part from amd had caused some minor issues for people and i definitely dont like the ram issues i see all the time on amd systems if it wasnt for the ram issues i may have gone amd this time out of all the intel systems i have assembled for customers over the years i have not once come across a ram issue that wasnt caused by bad ramthis cpu is working perfectly and gaming excellently gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good cpu and i am not having any issues with itif you are interested in any other intel parts i suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money for an i7 system though this is an excellent cpu and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen

"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi biosin gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive gamesupdatei have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset  if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less powerif youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht onthe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imccore wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen
"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw  for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great
"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.

I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable.

"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work.

"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable.

"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.

"I got this CPU because I've been a long term Intel user and I have never had problems with them. This one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work (mostly Office, Internet content) and gaming (COD MW3). In terms of power consumption and heat generation, I can hardly notice it since all the workload I put on it hardly heats it up more than 45C-50C. I'm not a video/photo content creator nor a streamer, so this works for me. For example, while playing COD MW3 and Ultra settings the CPU use is about 2% while my GPU, RTX 3080, carries 98% of the bottleneck workload.",i got this cpu because ive been a long term intel user and i have never had problems with them this one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work mostly office internet content and gaming cod mw3 in terms of power consumption and heat generation i can hardly notice it since all the workload i put on it hardly heats it up more than 45c50c im not a videophoto content creator nor a streamer so this works for me for example while playing cod mw3 and ultra settings the cpu use is about 2 while my gpu rtx 3080 carries 98 of the bottleneck workload

"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",i upgraded to this cpu after some heavy research asking reddit both intel and amd subreddits weighing in money vs performance gained i have used amd since i was a teen and started building computers the conclusion is this it is an amazing cpu runs faster and cooler than my ryzen 7 1700 the price and performance vs amd also including a board was better than if i had went with a ryzen 7 5800xsome background information i wanted to upgrade after receiving an amazon gift card i have never ordered computer parts from amazon though i upgraded from a ryzen 7 1700 with an asus x370f board i really wanted to upgrade and was sad also that windows 11 did not support my cpu i will give it to microsoft for this as it made a lot of people upgrade their entire computers all for basically the same os as of now with newer looks and not much done under the hood except for 12th gen intel so good news there too sadly my old board still doesnt support the ryzen 7 5000 series and only the 3000 series they are working on a bios apparently for the 5000 series because of people who were in my shoes i first almost ordered the ryzen 7 3800xt for 400 after a couple hours of research asking and thinking about it i cancelled that order thankfully and thought well if i am going to spend this much on upgrading my cpu i might as well go all inspend a little more for something better as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile i was then going to get the ryzen 7 5800x with an asus board there lied a problem of price i could not find a board and get that cpu still within my budget atleast not a board that wasnt worse than the one i had in ways i mentioned i had posted on the amd subreddit and even they suggested i go intel intel is just killing it as of now hands down although i am sure amd will retaliate i ended up getting the msi z690a ddr4 i wish i had the money for ddr5 ram i would have went with the ddr5 version as it was basically the same price i had a lot of second thoughts on this board though as it just didnt seem premium as the one i had i am going to do a whole review on it after this ill save my pros  cons for there this cpu also autoclocks itself up or down depending on the load saw it clock down to 1ghz although not for long for example if not much processing power is warranted which makes sense and i wish everything did so if idling it will clock down and save powerheatand therefore longevity is increased i absolutely love this cpu coming from amd anywaysif you have a corsair h100i rgb platinum or similar cooler already the included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this cpu even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kitscrews for this cpu which i did but they are taking forever to ship so i googled and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine i get better temps than my ryzen 7 1700 i can even overclock even more but have no need and no pointtldrupgraded from ryzen 7 1700 asus rog strix x370f gamingupgraded to i712700k msi z690a ddr4parts kept 4x8gb 32gb ddr4 cl16 3000mhz ram with xmp docp rtx 2070 the ram works great with this cpu as well although it technically latency wise runs at 2t on intel instead of 1t on amd runs slower than when on amd amds infinity fabric but obviously whatever intel is doing makes up for that and therefore my ram either runs fasterthe samepros it is an amazing cpu for price vs performance the i512600k is good as well i almost just went with it and you would be fine going with it for gaming as even it still has more cores technically than the ryzen 7 5800x it also beats the 5800x even though this cpu is supposed to be its comparison rival brother this cpu has cool temps on my corsair h100i rgb platinum cooler and the pe core structure are really cool and fun to watch when doing tasksgaming it shipped fastcons literally none with the cpu itself just with shipping  it shipped really fast was here in 23 days after purchasing on here the biggest complaint i have is amazons shipping so be aware of this i have never ordered computer parts from amazon and have always used newegg they just left the cpu in my mailbox and if it werent for me looking at my cameras and looking out for this part it would have sat in the mailbox all day my mailbox sadly is not very weather proof as well and if it had been raining it wouldnt have been good although it did come in a big box around it the cpu also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box not held into the front windowi hope this review helps people

"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",its pretty good value for money as far as intel cpus are concerned for a 12th gen cpu but if youre looking for the better value get the i513600k which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen cpu the only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard otherwise youll need to flash the bios on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen cpu i highly do not recommend doing this ive tried it a few and its such a big hassle many potential issuesthat i recommend first time pc builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen cpu along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard dont buy 12th gen mobo which obviously doesnt require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable

"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:1. i9-13900k2. i7-13700k3. i9-12900k4. i5-13600k5. i7-12700kThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route.

"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.Good luck!",its been roughly 67 years since i last build my gaming computer upgrading to this has been more than significant as of this writing i hope youve done your research the i712700ks price point and its competition for this price point it may be the top dogsome things to consider before purchasing1 make sure you are purchasing a lga 1700 motherboard i went with the ddr4 motherboard because ddr5 is still at its infancy the ddr5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now youll be fine with ddr42 this cpu does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor double check if your psu will be enough there are online resources that will help you calculate your psu its always good to have a little overhead3 make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws thats compatible with this motherboard you can purchase them separately if you have a heatsink thats very old 2016 its more than likely it may not be compatiblegood luck
"I had been planning to hold off for Raptor Lake, but my Z370 mobo died, and I decided to go ahead and get an Alder Lake i7.  So far it's impressive.  It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months.  3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.

I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.

"Upgraded to the 13700k from the 11900k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive. This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these high-end CPU's more or less all perform equal (or would if they all worked properly), but it's easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30-day window for return to Amazon is closed.",upgraded to the 13700k from the 11900k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive this 13th gen i7 k is officially intels fourth fastest cpu on paper but in real life its the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it 13900k14700k and 14900k are all plagued with issues that intel wont discuss but admits to albeit grudgingly until a fixall patch is released the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who wont be bothered with unpredictable bugs and bsod fests what good is it having a ferrari but with an engine thats goes offline 20 times a day  may as well go with a porsche that works at that level of performance these highend cpus more or less all perform equal or would if they all worked properly but its easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30day window for return to amazon is closed

"This processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old i7-6700K. According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in âecoâ mode in my motherboardâs settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you donât need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium.

"|The media could not be loaded.|In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case â compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included â actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180Â°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a) Â MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF, Â https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTXâ¢ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 HaloÂ² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion).",the media

"Purchased on sale for $334. The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt. Intel is still my preference for CPUs and I don't foresee that changing, especially with all of the issues I've read regarding AMD chips (boot up issues, crashes, poor multi-core performance).",purchased on sale for 334 the 13700k is the best value cpu if you require enough speed for highend gaming  productivity eg video editingrendering streaming multitasking etc this thing is fast i was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 55 ghz all pcore and 44 ghz all ecores i could go higher if i wanted to spend more time on it but this was a quick overclock perfectly stable and runs relativelycool with the undervolt intel is still my preference for cpus and i dont foresee that changing especially with all of the issues ive read regarding amd chips boot up issues crashes poor multicore performance
"My previous build had an i7-9700K and after 5 years of abuse, I decided to upgrade in this new build to an i7-13700K and I'm not disappointed.  It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it.  Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup.  During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues.

"The highest package temps my CPU gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees Celsius. And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how.

"I use this i7-13700K every day for about a year. I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use.

"After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year.  I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again.",after too many years of gaming on an old i76700k i finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year  i purchased the most up to date cpu and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did overall i think this is a great cpu however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things intel just keeps pushing these cpus harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of amd but in the process they are making cpus that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool after a lot of tweaking in the bios i finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree celsius threshold but that doesnt account for how hot it still makes my room when im gaming the extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months but as summer is approaching im wondering how this is going to pan outanyway the cpu is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box i didnt run into any errors or issues with this cpu overall i 100 recommend it because intel has never let me down ive been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too so thats a pretty long track record of cpus that just worked and never died because of that i can easily recommend this cpu and i would definitely order it again

"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade.

"The i7-13700K has i7-12900K performance at an i7 range price range. Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboardâs vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMDâs expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intelâs 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me).

"This was the first Generation 13 processor we used in a build. Of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that. Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation.  The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2Â°-3Â° C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions.

"Amazing CPU, noticed huge improvements in performance almost everywhere (faster load times, higher FPS in games, etc.) Performance was especially noticeable in CPU heavy games such as WoW, that don't require as much GPU power and are heavily bottlenecked by CPU. In cases like those I doubled FPS going from 9th gen to 13th gen Intel.One thing to note: 13th gen Intel is HOT! You may be coming from an older CPU and used to 60-70 C temperatures at max, then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot. That's just how it is. If you're worried about longevity, set an undervolt offset of about -0.10 (preferably in your motherboard's BIOS settings) and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability.",amazing cpu noticed huge improvements in performance almost everywhere faster load times higher fps in games etc performance was especially noticeable in cpu heavy games such as wow that dont require as much gpu power and are heavily bottlenecked by cpu in cases like those i doubled fps going from 9th gen to 13th gen intelone thing to note 13th gen intel is hot you may be coming from an older cpu and used to 6070 c temperatures at max then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot thats just how it is if youre worried about longevity set an undervolt offset of about 010 preferably in your motherboards bios settings and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability

"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money.

"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi biosin gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive gamesupdatei have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset  if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less powerif youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht onthe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imccore wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen
"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw  for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great

"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.",i decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didnt justify the price difference considering i was already getting about 13 more performance than my 12th generation i9 i wanted plenty of motherboard resources so i also bought the msi meg z790 ace 32 gb of kingston fury 6400mts ddr5 and a 2tb samsung 990 nvme drivecooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9 even with a 360mm aio cooler so i went custom loop along the way i found a gpu water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling the thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators but i wanted some disks so i went for a 560x140 and a 280x140 both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans four more fans feed air into the case and theres till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged inso whats the result the processor runs at 85c worst case and only two cores at that temperature the fast ddr5 does make a significant difference i initially ran it at 6gts then turned it up to 62 and finally 64 the last change is a 35 change in ddr5 speed and that gave me a 24 increase in system speed i kept my old rtx3070 which used to run over 80c and now runs at 62c worst case so despite more performance the system runs a lot cooleri mostly run xplane 12 which runs the gpu and cpu very hard continuously after several hours the cooling water reached 36c and the worst core temperature was 85c the processor just works no stability issues with the standard settings on the msi z690 motherboard there are three standard memory tuning options for 60 62 and 64 gts and all work this will do for me for a few years
"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast.

"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1.

"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.

"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly.

Pretty nice but architecture wise it's not that radically advanced from a 13 gen i7.Still I like how balanced the performance is. Multithreaded tasks work like a charm. It's actually very stable with high speed RAM modules. And for gaming everyone tells how AMD's 7950X3D is better but honestly I find absolutely zero issues to deal with. Missing out on 5% FPS speed is something I'd rather have than dealing with switching between the 3DV CCD and a 7950X's CCD messing up qith performance or the inability to overclock (plus zero issues with asus rog motherboards),pretty nice but architecture wise its not that radically advanced from a 13 gen i7still i like how balanced the performance is multithreaded tasks work like a charm its actually very stable with high speed ram modules and for gaming everyone tells how amds 7950x3d is better but honestly i find absolutely zero issues to deal with missing out on 5 fps speed is something id rather have than dealing with switching between the 3dv ccd and a 7950xs ccd messing up qith performance or the inability to overclock plus zero issues with asus rog motherboards
"For the effective heat transfer to be better the CPU die would have to be larger. More surface contact with pump would increase effective cooling. That is my only complaint.The concentrated heat in the processor make it hard for the cooler / pump to keep the temps down. No matter the size of the cooler the heat transfer is the bottleneck for cooling of the CPU.The processor will no matter the cooler reach 100Â°C in about 30 seconds under full load. To keep the temps down you need to throttle power limits in motherboard BIOS and lose some performance. But effectively if you do so, CPU will no longer cap at 100Â°C, but be somewhere under 80Â°C, on average 60-70Â°C.Other than that its a beast.",for the effective heat transfer to be better the cpu die would have to be larger more surface contact with pump would increase effective cooling that is my only complaintthe concentrated heat in the processor make it hard for the cooler  pump to keep the temps down no matter the size of the cooler the heat transfer is the bottleneck for cooling of the cputhe processor will no matter the cooler reach 100c in about 30 seconds under full load to keep the temps down you need to throttle power limits in motherboard bios and lose some performance but effectively if you do so cpu will no longer cap at 100c but be somewhere under 80c on average 6070cother than that its a beast

"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money.

"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi biosin gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive gamesupdatei have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset  if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less powerif youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht onthe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imccore wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen
"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw  for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great

"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work.

"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly.",this processor is a speed demon gaming editing encoding and whatever else you can think of it can handle the performance is there the value for money is quite good too unless you really want top of the line this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration 20 cores 8p and 12e boost up to 56ghz on 2 threads i swapped a 12600k for this part and im still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps this is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower i wouldnt consider building new with it howevertheres a cost to this cpu though heat and power draw i have an arctic liquid freezer iii 360 aio on this chip and even with a sizable undervolt it still throttles at around 230w running 100c it feels like this chip is almost uncoolable unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something i considered a large air cooler for this chip and im glad i went with an aio buyer beware this thing runs hot its also incredibly fast if you can cool it this thing will fly

"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.

"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler.

"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.

"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly.

"|The media could not be loaded.|I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering.

"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",this isnt the processor for everyone but it is very fast the individual cores arent significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7 but if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you i do software development which it doesnt help 99 of the time gaming which it helps a little and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music during transcoding it helps a huge amount i have over 300gb of flac audio files that i ripped from my cd collection i never buy mp3s i wanted to have that on my phone but i didnt want to carry it at full rate because i cant tell the difference in the car so i transcoded it i had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old ryzen 7 this machine took around 30 minutes 3040 times faster at work the optics team which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses uses i9s in preference to xeons the xeons might be faster under some circumstances but the machines are hugely expensive so the i9s are much better for price performance would i buy it again id probably buy the 13th generation but if i had any sense id just get the 13th gen i7

"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",purchased this cpu to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that i have had for close to 4 years now and considering i also own a 3090 i was lucky enough to get last year it was time paired with said gpu and a msi tomahawk z690 with a noctua nhd15 chromax black cooler this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like discord would introduce very bad stutter however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k temps are high when im doing full resolution photo renders from my dji air 2s or sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking but that is expected and im not one to sweat about 8090c temps but if you are i would recommend the 12700k5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage however in gaming with multiple different firefox tabs and discordtelegram open it never even touches 70c so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well as my system can suck north of 600750w full tilt my power supply being a 1200w platinum evga that doesnt break a sweat under full load

"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get.

I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming.

It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace.

"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250.",the 12900k can be hard to justify the 12700k is around twothirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent furthermore you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more even while using the nhd15 cpu cooler i decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k given the option to do it over i would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about 250

"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily.

This CPU is power hungry under load but in games the CPU is fast. This also works fine for workstation workloads but this shines in gaming for sure. Also if you have the cooling this CPU can be clocked even higher for better performance.

"It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80Â°C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80Â°C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80Â°c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently.

"It worked fine for 6 months, then i start running into Error Code 0xC0000005 with lots of various applications in Windows 11.  I figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing, and I dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues.  I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues.  I try replacing the memory, still issues.  I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues.  I try windows 10.... still issues.  I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code.  They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky.",it worked fine for 6 months then i start running into error code 0xc0000005 with lots of various applications in windows 11  i figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing and i dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues  i reset the os still issues i do a fresh clean install still issues  i try replacing the memory still issues  i try installing win 11 with a different boot installer still issues  i try windows 10 still issues  i try reinstalling it 2 more times still the same issuei decide to go to micro center to have them diagnose the issue while i am there their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code  they take it in and in 2 days message me saying its the cpu  they tried the cpu in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up  so i go and pick up the machinei try to file a warrenty claim with intel but their login system was broken for a week so i had to chat with a support person  we spend 1 hour typing about the issue  i send him screenshots of the cpu itself the text from microcenter the recepit from amazon screenshot of the bios showing all my hardware information a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter a screenshot of the error codei wait a week or so i can finally log into intel website and i dont see a support ticket  i open up chat again  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address  they assign it and forward the support response to meand the response says they cant contact microcenter to confirm it  and that its not a cpu issue anyways because that code is due to an os issuean os issue  i ask them to reiterate their point because if its an os issue that means they dont believe me and microcenter  i also pointed out again that i have installed windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times and they respond with i need documentation from microcenter  so they dont believe me and they believe this is an os issue stillit has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless i send the documentation from micro center nowworks great but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky

"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU.",so first things first this is a genuinely powerful cpu thats been able to handle basically every task that ive thrown at it it runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with easenow with that out of the way thermals this thing gets hot and i mean really hot if youre going with air cooling i strongly recommend a double tower sixeight pipe air cooler like the corsair a115 or a cooler master ma824 if you are going the aio route anything less than a 360mm aio will under perform for that go with any 360mm aio from any brand of your choice if you have the space go with a 420mm aio for the best resultsfinally there has been recent reports of cpu degradation and instability when using this cpu i am using this with an asus rog strix z790h motherboard and it basically juiced the cpu like no tomorrow until i applied intels power settings for this cpu this likely is the cause of the degradation be sure to check intels website for recommended power settings also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k cpu out of intels specificationsin conclusion heres my personal experience the cpu functions but i can not use asus ai overclocking feature as i get a bsod with the clockwatchdogtimeout error and apps will randomly crash you probably shouldnt use any ai assisted overclocking feature if you can help it even running this at stock there is still a substantial amount of performance in this cpu if you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your cpu i would just wait for meteorlake or just go with amdfinal note i am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my cpu
"I initially got a 13700K, but grabbed this after and snubbed the 14 gen. I upgraded from 8700K, ***which is still a very capable cpu even today, but due to the demands of certain programs the 13900K is handling them better than the 13700K so far.Fingers crossed to hoping it will not fail in future. There are well documented power issues that Intel and their partners have with the 13th, 14th gen.

"We set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday - to make a long story short, we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7-11th gen we had from before.The surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines, we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others.  We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.  This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  This is a huge surprise.

"I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset.  It didn't boot when I set it all up.  It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU.  Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint.A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.  They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.  So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great.",i got this and a new ddr5 motherboard with z690 chipset  it didnt boot when i set it all up  it turns out the z690 needs a bios update to work with this cpu  luckily i had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard  i dropped it in and it booted then i did the bios update  after that it boots this cpu just finebefore this i was a diehard amd supporter  i had 5950x with 16 cores 32 threads and 72mb of cache  but it just doesnt compete with this i9  i havent tried the 7950x but i read that the pcores just blow away the amd cores  even with less cache  the setup of 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores just works  it stays much cooler than earlier i9s and the amd  i use a water cooler but its not required  nothing slows this down when paired with ddr5i wish the amd was better i like the company more  but i want the best of the best and as of today there is nothing better than this available  if you game or do graphics or anything on your pc this is the cpu for you  it will not disappointa word on the x790 chipset  you would think they will have better performance because they are newer  they dont  they will work with the i9 no matter what while the z690 might need a bios update  they have one more usb port  but otherwise there is no benefit to getting z790 and they cost a lot more  so if you have the ability to use an older cpu to flash the bios or find one that is new enough that it doesnt need the update this cpu will be great
"This CPU unit is a beast, upgraded from a i7 8700k...the improvement was HUGE. Doubled my FPS in WoW, and there is no more lag! Nevertheless, after 6 months of regular use, it started failing...many kernel errors until it finally became useless. I could, somehow, return it to INTEL (from PerÃº to USA). Great support outside US...but such a complex and expensive unit cannot fail that quickly without heavy usage, at least in my opinion.",this cpu unit is a beast upgraded from a i7 8700kthe improvement was huge doubled my fps in wow and there is no more lag nevertheless after 6 months of regular use it started failingmany kernel errors until it finally became useless i could somehow return it to intel from per to usa great support outside usbut such a complex and expensive unit cannot fail that quickly without heavy usage at least in my opinion
"I really like this CPU and it has worked well for my needs. Many had the issue of overheating, throttling and even bending in some instances. I have not experienced any of this since I knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the BIOS to keep this monster CPU running cool. It seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues. All you need to to is look up the specs for your CPU and setup the BIOS of your motherboard accordingly.I am using the Aorus Waterforce X 280 with Artic MX-6 Thermal Paste just in case you are curious.

I've had it for about 4-5months now, before it started cooling off outside I was have to crank the A/C to keep my gaming room cool and now that its cooling off outside (30-40 f at night) I have blocked off the vents in the room to prevent any additional heat.

"This processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card. I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesnât generate that much heat either.

Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, donât be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you donât want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent.

"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.

"Excellent processor. It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one.Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100Â°C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67Â°C) but is something to be aware of.All in all happy with this beast",excellent processor it is a beast in gaming and in productivity for the price i believe is unrivaled beware that you should separately buy a cpu cooler because it does not come with onealso beware that most motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the bios so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit for example im using an 360mm aio cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my aorus elite ax when running cinebench it reaches 100c within 12 seconds of starting of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games there the max ive seen the cpu get is 67c but is something to be aware ofall in all happy with this beast

"If it have the money to spare and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) its a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it to most users.If you're just using the PC as a high-end gaming rig an i7-13700k is more than enough even with a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the cheaper 13700k. Also this processor is notoriously hot, so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm+ watercooler AIO is necessary (especially for overclocking).",if it have the money to spare and want a processor thatll last you at least 5 years and are a power user like i am its a good choice but most people say the advantages over the 13700k arent worth it to most usersif youre just using the pc as a highend gaming rig an i713700k is more than enough even with a 4090 gpu this processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so id save the 150 and get the cheaper 13700k also this processor is notoriously hot so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm watercooler aio is necessary especially for overclocking

"The Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor is just a fantastic super-fast processor that does have 24 cores when needed for heavy applications. Get yourself an AIO cooler like the Artic Freezer II 360 size and you're all set. No real need to overclock this CPU. It also works great for heavy applications and gaming. Has plenty of fast L 3 cache on die so there's no delay or speed issues. It also runs my Team Group DDR 5 7800Mhz ram with no problem on my Maximus Z790 Hero chipset Motherboard. Wanted to get the EVGA Z790 Kingpin motherboard but it sells out very fast within minutes.Great CPU and I'm very happy that I've bought the Intel 13900K.

"My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases.

"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money.

"I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some.  I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good.

Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!

"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi biosin gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive gamesupdatei have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset  if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less powerif youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht onthe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imccore wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen
"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw  for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great
"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.

"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360.

"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work.

"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable.

"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.

"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional.

"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1.

This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .,this is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors if you put too much voltage you are going to damage it i want to delid it but i dont see the need and here is whyeven if i can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter it will still need 35 to 42 volts to stay stable at advertised speedsi am running it  54 ghz all p cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable  and maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 57 to 60 ghzi get the point that ppl want to have the bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit i think that 54 53 52 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded  and most games are gpu bound i only use it in the gaming department for flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degreesi had a 4770 k and still running strong at 45 ghz in a very small caseintel is a beast and this i 9 is very good  future proof for at least 5 years to come note i have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage  they are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them i have been running this cpu 24 7 not an issuenot a blue screenjust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go this thing is a monster
"This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.

I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.

"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super.

"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome.",once they came down in price i did get a i914900k as an upgrade from a i913900kf to  i914900k   its ok but i cant rave over it  it is more of an sideways change rather than an upgradethe i914900k is fast but not more so that a i913900k  for me the cinebench r23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen  though the i914900k appears to run ddr5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i913900k  also the i914900k is enabled for xtu ai enable tuning in xtu but its not that helpful  i even wonder if it is worth getting a k at all these cpus are plenty fast for gaming without overclockingi did not notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures  maybe a slight improvement but i did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so i am doubtful that the running temps are better  also i suggest that you not let these chips get anywhere near tjmax 100c  i had one i913900kf literally fail due to allowing it to get to tjmax frequently when stress testing  a second one became slightly flakyi thought the built in arc display support of the k version might be helpful since i intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the builtin arc on a side display  but as it turns out it wasnt worth it for me  if you are gaming with this level of processor you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays  imo you are better off getting a kf and spending the money so saved on better graphics cardthe original asking price was insane i bought it on a whim on a late night  on the morning morning after i had buyers remorse tried to cancel but could not so instead i refused the package  it took literally 6 months to get a refund  that was rather irksome

"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80â° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)",a lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k i say who cares if you have a 13900k dont upgrade but if you have an older pc or 12th gen this is a worthy upgrade i absolutely love mine its a monster of a cpui honestly dont recommend air cooling it it can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits which most people dont know how to do let alone even know what that meansif youre not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k i recommend you do what ive done to cool mine you dont neeeed to but it helps i have an aio allinone cooler and i setup a pushpull configuration on my radiator that means i have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case both are blowing upward it creates more airflow one side is pushing the air the other side is helping pull that air through then i got a thermalright contact frame any lga 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap it might say 12th13th gen but it will also work on 14th gen so get an aio setup a pushpull fan configuration and get a contact frame its helping my temps significantly i typically stay in the high 50s or low 60s during 4k gaming this cpu draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80 occasionally for a very brief moment maybe 1 second or less

"Easy to install if you know what you're doing. Be careful to not bend or break the pins. Apply thermal paste any way you like, thare is no ""best"" way - I go with an X pattern. The most important part is to ensure an even spread of paste on the dye, without any air gaps. You  can test how good your coverage is by applying the paste in any pattern you like, sit and press the cooler on the dye, then remove it and examine. If the spread/coverage looks good, clean the processor and cooler dyes, reapply paste, reseat and mount the cooler.",easy to install if you know what youre doing be careful to not bend or break the pins apply thermal paste any way you like thare is no best way  i go with an x pattern the most important part is to ensure an even spread of paste on the dye without any air gaps you  can test how good your coverage is by applying the paste in any pattern you like sit and press the cooler on the dye then remove it and examine if the spreadcoverage looks good clean the processor and cooler dyes reapply paste reseat and mount the cooler

"After reading so many reviews about the heat issues, I took the plunge and bought this, paired with the Noctua NH-U12A Chromax Black. All I can say is what a pairing - I do some heavy photo processing on Lightroom / Photoshop and some casual gaming and the processor temp range is anywhere between late 40 to 80 degrees which is pretty good.  Perhaps not the performance jump I was expecting moving from the old I7-4770K but that is probably more due to the poor optimisation on Lightroom.",after reading so many reviews about the heat issues i took the plunge and bought this paired with the noctua nhu12a chromax black all i can say is what a pairing  i do some heavy photo processing on lightroom  photoshop and some casual gaming and the processor temp range is anywhere between late 40 to 80 degrees which is pretty good  perhaps not the performance jump i was expecting moving from the old i74770k but that is probably more due to the poor optimisation on lightroom
