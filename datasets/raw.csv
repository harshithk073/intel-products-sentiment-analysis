must buy for gamers
been using it since an year no problem at all can run any current aaa game can handle multi tasking mid to not very high level gaming with no problems if u have other good combination of components integrated
caution  price k is overprice now please buy it under k only otherwise check some other applicationssites for better price
the cpu is overall great for everything itll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming if you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy but the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler first of all i would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnt and also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting also the performance is not nice many would say stock cooler is more than enough for f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched  degrees so i took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going  to degrees and it was approx the same case while gaming idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling so be careful with the stock cooler or i would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like india where it gets to  degrees easily and you dont have an ac in your room aio is the choice
best processor in this price range best performance all togethe
it is a good processor to build a low budget computer in this processor you have to install a separate graphic card for the display i would also say that installing a cooler or a liquid cooler is also very important because this processor heats up more
got this product in good package i have paired this cpu with my rx  and  gb ram  mhzif you are looking for budget gaming this is excellentgaming benchmarkassassins creed unity  fps high settingapex legends  fps ultra settingspubg steam  fps very high settingsthe cpu temp goes to c max during intensive gameplay for  hours make sure to put heatsink correctly stock cooler is enoughi am using msi hmg motherboard the stock cooler gives enough room for ram sticksmake sure to have psu of at least  watt
i bought the processor for an h v from nzxt it runs without any problems on an asus strix bi with x ddr mhz cl highly recommended
delivered in perfect condition and on time
ive owned more expensive cpus  up to amd ryzen  and intel k in most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages most of the work i was doing offloaded everything to my gpu so having a beastly cpu was a wasteive downgraded to this cpu in my main desktop rig its great for productivity software music and design work as well as gaming i have it paired with a rtx  series card and havent noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming maybe  fps in most games i max out the monitors hzfps at pone different thing about this cpu over other intel offerings is that it has  performance cores with  threads  hyperthreading and no low powered efficiency cores they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery powerthe cpu is also very efficient and runs quite cool mine is c when idle and  light tasks such as browsing the web during gaming  the temps are usually in the mid s benchmarking such as cinebench and geekbench etc reaches mid s i am using a twofan deepcool as plus air cooler with three case mm fansall in all  very happy with purchase and highly recommend
 if is a th generation intel processor based on the alder lake architecture it stands out for its nm engraving its support for pcie  and thunderbolt  and its compatibility with ddr or ddr memory it is a processor without an integrated graphics circuit which involves the use of a dedicated graphics card the core if has  highperformance cores pcore and  threads thanks to hyperthreading technology it has a base frequency of  ghz and can reach up to  ghz in turbo mode it also has an mb l cache and a mb l cache the core if offers remarkable performance in applications and games it is proving capable of competing with higherend processors such as the ryzen  x from amd or the core ik from intel it is particularly good at tasks that make use of multithreading such as video encoding compression or rendering it also ensures optimal fluidity in the latest games even in high resolution the core if also stands out for its energy efficiency it has a base power consumption of  watts and a maximum power consumption of  watts   it is therefore easy to cool and does not require a cooling system that is too expensive or noisy it also reduces the electricity bill and the environmental impact so the core if is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful versatile and energyefficient processor it offers unbeatable value for money to take full advantage of the benefits of intels th generation however it requires a motherboard compatible with the lga socket and a dedicated graphics card
so far so good i feel the difference compared to my old  processor and there is no bottleneck with my rtxti video card
as it should be instead of buying laptops and preassembled laptops a real nerd builds a computer himself and in addition to this he shares his experience in the ancient art of pc building also with friends and relatives my brother needed to use a computer and imagining the sadness of seeing him with a laptop a preassembled one or even worse with a mac i decided to build him a custommade computer and anyway what better way to convert someone to pc gaming than with a computer assembled with a lot of brotherly love so i decided to choose this processor because since it is a build primarily for school use  gaming and with a relatively limited budget ok brotherly love and everything but lets not exaggerate it seemed to me the best compromise between performance and quality in the end the seller sent me the f but i wanted the  so i made the return and i bought the  which in any case is identical apart from the integrated gpu and slightly higher frequencies so i can review it anyway since they are essentially the same processor it is a core thread processor which does not have the elusive ecores of the most expensive series for example the  has pcores like this plus ecores that help with background operations especially if you use windows  at a frequency of  ghz with a boost of up to  ghz if temperatures workload and your motherboard allow it a processor of this type excels in gaming but it doesnt suck even in the most complicated operations in fact this processor also performs very well in video editing with adobe premiere i combined it with a gigabyte rtx g and gb of ddr at mhz all on an asus bma prime performance and temperatures as i said before it is a midrange processor particularly suitable for gaming but which manages even the most professional operations without a hitch the architecture of these twelfthgeneration intel processors after a fairly disappointing eleventh generation is excellent without giving the numbers with benchmarks and other incomprehensible things i can tell you that in gaming it behaves at the same level as the good old ryzen  x undoubtedly the best midrange processor along with this one i dont think youll have problems with gaming or productivity using this processor provided the rest of the hardware is up to par i use it with trivial ddr at mhz so in terms of performance we are similar to the x i had on my build last year but if you combine it with a bit serious ddr it can certainly exceed it even if by a little bit in any case it performs very well in gaming especially when combined with a somewhat serious gpu like my rtx i havent noticed bottlenecks especially in the case of this build which will be used with a only p monitor as for temperatures this is a fairly quiet cpu with a tdp of only w at the moment i dont have a sink because it hasnt arrived so im using the stock sink included in the package i expected it would suck but its definitely acceptable temperatures do not exceed c in gaming even with heavy games while making the most of it with a cinebench it does not exceed c which is acceptable and well below the c throttling threshold even the sound of the original fan is quite low so well maybe ill keep it with the stock sink certainly however my case an nzxt with  additional fans helps a lot besides this i didnt trust the veil of preapplied thermal paste and i put my trusty gelid gc extreme in it because for a w processor with the dissi stock you certainly need an extreme level of thermal paste f version or not f tray or box integrated gpu the difference between the two versions lies in the availability of the integrated gpu the f version does not include it and it generally costs a little less depending on the difference in price consider whether to take one or the other i am not a fan of intel integrated gpus and i always try whenever possible to combine a dedicated gpu even if very scarce in this case i have the rtx which is a good gaming card so why did i want to get the processor with the integrated gpu because with certain programs that support intel quicksync technology the integrated gpu is not there to sleep but is actively used for video encoding or for other operations such as the timeline in premiere the little brother uses adobe premiere which can take advantage of this technology but other video editing or streaming programs also use it such as obs studio which can use the video encoder of the integrated gpu to trim leaving the dedicated gpu free for the game in any case the integrated gpu is the usual intel uhd on the  it is the uhd  on the  the  i havent tested it much in gaming but anyway dont expect who knows what the power of this is similar to the entry levels dedicated to laptops from a few years ago such as the m or so so its good for light games in any case it has no problems whatsoever when it comes to viewing videos or d images that are not particularly complex it can handle k videos on youtube or retro games and various emulators without problems as for other cryptic nomenclatures sometimes we see tray or box the difference between the two is the presence of a sink in the box version as i said above the cooler is poor but for a cpu like this it is sufficient if on the other hand you dont need it take the tray version should i take the   or  in my opinion among these three the best is the  and ill also explain why the  and the  are brothers while the  is in effect the superior model lets start with the  this processor has the same base as the  but with slightly higher base and boost frequencies as well as a slightly more powerful integrated gpu namely the intel uhd  against the  of the  higher frequencies essentially translate into a static improvement of an average of  more or less depending on the workload but practically never above  the integrated gpu is a little more powerful but it is always a very poor integrated one that is not suitable for gaming regardless if the price difference were about ten euros it could even be there but honestly i cant think of any reason why the  deserves to exist at almost  more avoid it i bought it only because i needed it in a hurry and the seller made a mistake in sending me the f instead of the  otherwise i would never have bought it the  on the other hand is on another playing field and is in effect the superior model as i said at the beginning in addition to the  pcores the  has  ecores as well as higher frequencies and the k version if you want to overclock for the price of almost  above  it could even fit you if its within your budget and you do intense multitasking or a lot of rendering operations in gaming they are practically the same the difference between the two can be perceived at high frame rates and low resolutions in aaa games perhaps in k you will be limited by the gpu in most cases in any case if you want to assemble a pc with a higher budget than mine and perhaps combined with a more powerful gpu than my  it could be worth it even if only because of the presence of ecores however i believe that the  is the sweet spot to consider for any midrange pc possibly considering an upgrade in a few years to the xxx generation when prices fall conclusion what can i say the  is a respectable cpu at a very affordable price among other things it is excellent in a midrange gaming build combined with a somewhat serious gpu and it doesnt work even in professional graphics programs used at an amateur or school level im definitely not telling you anything new but i fully recommend it for midrange builds and a low budget
switched from th gen i k to f i can feel the significant improvement especially with daily tasks and games it works perfectly i got ddr mhz cl ram as well works without a problem combined with  ti consumes such little power and gets everything i need done so fari got a noctua cooler for it though works really quiet and cool perfect for the price about sek cheaper than the version with integrated graphics but there are low profile gpus in case you want it as a simple daily or office use
fit ratio but there is one very important detail no gpu included in other words your computer needs a graphics card to work unlike other processors with a gpu included an important detail
  a world of difference everything loads immediately no more delays in addition to an rx  almost all games at p at at least fps
easy purchase fast delivery and product quality
price performance gamingthis cpu is beyond amazing and then you see the price and holy moly it is a powerhouse at an unbelievable price
 a long time of use and several tests i concluded my opinions by listing the various strengths and weaknesses of this processor multicore  performance with six cores and twelve threads it excels in multithreaded tasks such as video rendering and d modeling offering remarkable performance for a midrange processor balanced gaming game performance is solid ensuring a stable frame rate in recent games effective thread management contributes to a better gaming experience smooth productivity for everyday productivity tasks such as web browsing document processing and multitasking the processor offers a fast and smooth experience energy consumption thanks to the alder lake architecture and advanced manufacturing processes energy consumption is low contributing to greater efficiency detailed defects of the intel i f   lack of integrated graphics the lack of an integrated graphics unit implies the need to purchase a discrete graphics card increasing the total cost especially if the user does not yet own one overclocking limitations for those interested in overclocking the processor may not offer the same capabilities as the k variants in the same family thermal dissipation in intensive workloads the processor can generate heat requiring an adequate cooling system to prevent overheating overall the intel i f represents a balanced choice offering an excellent compromise between performance price and energy efficiency its performance varies depending on usage but overall its a reliable processor for a variety of tasks
 i just bought this f because amazon had it for  for one day  thats when i changed my f and it was worth it in games its not noticeable with older ones but current titles bring more fps but above all the game runs a bit smoother so somehow smoother the min fps are higher in office applications it doesnt matter if  or  core its not noticeable but when i convert an mkv file to avi it saves about  time with the arcitc freezer esport duo it does not run above c in office mode not above c in games and not above c when converting files  output what do i want more and since im sure i can still get my old f away the new one is all the cheaper
 the moment i installed this intel processor in my computer i was impressed by its exceptional performance despite its affordable price this processor handles all my daily tasks with ease from web browsing to word processing and video editing what really stands out is its ability to handle multiple applications simultaneously without slowing down in addition its energy efficiency is remarkable which means that its not only good for my pocket but also good for the environment in short this intel processor offers a perfect balance between price and performance its an excellent choice for anyone looking to upgrade their system without spending a fortune i highly recommend it
\i am not a configuration pro and my knowledge is basic i needed to replace an old failed i k either the motherboard or the proc im not sure technology has evolved very quickly in  years and after some research i quickly came across this i f with a very good value for money well i am very satisfied with it its faster overall i make a lot of subprime videos and i have gained in comfort there is less freeze on big rigs i used the supplied fan no worries it doesnt heat up much and the thermal paste is preinstalled for a low budget upgrade cmproc around  euros this is a very good configuration i was able to keep all my old pc case graphics card power supply with the nvme hard drive and my  ram strips without worries
bought this for a new build i was doing performed great for the price and runs cool just using the stock cooler it came withno hesitation in recommending for quality and performance verses price
 it is not yet up but for the price of  euros at the time of black friday it was impossible to miss this i f it is good for fhd quad hd and k gaming you can overclock with some motherboards for streaming no problem and the small pro application without too much rendering etc it will also do the trick if you send below  euros go for it you will not be disappointed in addition it is compatible with ddr and ddr so can be scalable in a configuration cant wait to finish the configuration
 intel core if is a th generation desktop processor that offers great value for money it features  cores and  threads with a base frequency of  ghz and a turbo frequency of  ghz gaming performance   the core if is capable of offering excellent gaming performance in a midrange build in full hd it can handle most modern games without problems even with high graphics settings in k it can still offer playable performance but you need to lower your graphics settings computing performance   the core if is also a great choice for multithreaded computing it can easily handle tasks such as video encoding photo editing and spreadsheet processing power consumption   the core if is an energy efficient processor it has a tdp of  w which means that it does not require a particularly powerful cooling system conclusions   the intel core if is a great choice for gamers looking for a powerful and affordable processor it offers excellent gaming performance in full hd and highquality multithreaded processing performance pros   great value for money excellent gaming  performance in full hd highquality multithreaded processing  performance efficient power  consumption   cons   not suitable for k gaming at high graphics settings  verdict   if youre looking for a powerful and affordable cpu for your next midrange gaming pc the intel core if is a great option
great
gewoon goedjhonjust goodjhon
well nuff said it works  stars for you sir
 top processor that makes all games run very well even at high resolution im going to stream well and the tests ive done so far are very positive with very little lag this version of i can totally compete with older versions of i placing it on the motherboard is very easy i did not know but the fan is included in it with a paste to stick the processor the fixings on it are correct and easy to fix very good product i recommend
works well
great for the price i only have one application open at a time ie every game runs without any problems
for a first pc configuration i set myself a budget of  euro for this type of configuration the i f is definitely recommended to see in use
it offers good performance and good temperatures at a good price both for gaming and office automation or video editing
arrived in good condition and very fast
 of the moment for pricequality ratio it always depends on the use you have to make but anyway efficient even for obviously not extreme gaming as it is an f and not a k perfect for builds like mine with gb ddr ram rtx  quiet with standard heatsink
would be useful to specify which boards it will work with as plug and play no longer exist
it great if youre trying to make a midrange pc but you could spent a little more and get the ik or the i
 processor delivery was made after  day the best processor you can buy in the price range in my opinion ive been using it for  months and im very satisfied the included cooler is also okay it cools the processor sufficiently but not necessarily quietd  then i would rather recommend a good cpu cooler as it doesnt cost much
whats that noise oh its a broken cooler fan blade intel qa must have missed this one shame
 is a good processor with a relatively low price for these capabilities games like destiny  enshrouded and helldivers  work great with it
un procesador con muy buen rendimientobuena calidadtemperaturas muy correctas y sobretodo muy buen precioa processor with very good performance good quality very correct temperatures and above all a very good price
ipurchased during prime day for  this processor carries  cores and  threads on its shoulders which although it may seem obvious has now become the standard for gaming lets not fool ourselves even if the starting clock is  ghz know that the motherboard activates the turbo boost and gets you up to  ghz as far as consumption is concerned in normal use it is below w w in the maximum games it recorded then it depends a maximum load of w under stress w precise net as stated by intel but now lets move on to the damn sore point that has been haunting these processors for years the heatsink i have tried several heatsinks and i must say that they have worked even if the pushpin system remains cumbersome it doesnt fit perfectly i know it seems strange to you but even if its not perfectly attached it still covers the entire dissipating surface you can rest assured ingame the maximum temperature i recorded with an ambient temperature of c was c then when i tried with an ambient temperature of c the temperature dropped to c they seem like high values but trust me that for a stock sink it does its dirty job for this reason i give it  stars update august    i have deactivated the intel turbo boost and now even when i play it never rises above c thus lowering the temperature by c even if you lose that  ghz know that it is equally powerful and you have no stability problems so im updating the review to  stars midaugust   update   the stock sink has abandoned me temperatures rose to c and then it goes under protection apparently it must be mounted perfectly or else it cant be done so im replacing it with a tower i dont recommend using that stock if you dont want to run into these unpleasant inconveniences update to  in the hope of not having any further problems
i love this cpu and its price tag it can handle the newest games well and works quite well for graphic design applications the only issue i have with this is your ram is locked to a maximum of mhz if you want to get it higher consider a kf
good single thread performance with  cores and  threads relatively low power too w so suitable for silent pc at much lower price point than t coded cpus w
arrived very well packaged fast and everything as shown but my pc isnt complete yet so ill be able to just test another time eventually but theres no problem because this purchase really is reliable
 good processor
brilliant for my windows  upgrade
if you want to build a cheap build this is a good processor especially when it is at a prime discount i recommend replacing the stock cooler with something more valid and quieter but if you are really tight on a budget the stock is also fine it can still have its say in  especially when paired with a good video card eg rx  and a decent motherboard
 for less than  this processor is very powerful cooled by a cooler master hyper  and mounted on an asus tuf b gaming d it does not exceed
costbenefit
received this today cpu was pre used and rattling around in the box in a sandwich bag thermal paste smeared around the cooler and cpu
 got it very cheap but i dont know if i made a good choice with a  gb  i still have problems rendering videos i think i would recommend an effort for the th generation i the more power this i i see it short
i used this cpu for my first ever pc build i pared it with an rtx  gb eagle edition its works together great
the processor is one of the best in terms of performance and price but if it is also made oc by bclk it is second to none
still waiting for my refund after a faulty mother board ruined the cpu and possibly my gpu amson customer service is terrible have absolutely no understanding of technical stuff and couldnt care less that im sat here with no computer unable to make aliving and wont even compensate for the rest of the damage the faulty mother board has caused to my pc quick enough to take my money but every excuse under the sun not to give it bk
 i am absolutely impressed by the cpu   for the price there is nothing to complain about when it comes to gaming i think the cpu is also aimed at such devices due to the lack of igpu first of all there are only  minus points that are not so significant for me personally  no igpu without your own graphics card no picture   boxed cooler can be immediately disposed of despite the specified  watts with boxed cooler above  degrees   then to the plus points    performance for just  you get a cpu with which you can actually play any game above the  fps mark temperatures even when the boxed cooler is not suitable the cpu can be kept at  to  degrees even under full load with a normal air cooler  which is absolutely great there is simply nothing to complain about for this price and every p player up to hertz should enjoy the cpu system  asus h gaming matx board  intel i f  xgb ddr corsair memory  ghost gainward  gb  aero cool  lux xgb ssd crucial you dont need more as long as you dont play in k
 best costbenefit to work with
great processor for the price
i ordered the cpu but when it arrived a fan propeller was broken
atried a couple of weeks combined with an rtx  on some online games i think its a really great processor its coming down in price or with various offers its between  and  euros and at this price i dont think you could ask for better the only drawback it will be the new architecture it will be the bios of the motherboards but the turbo core does not go to  ghz on all the cores at the same time as it was on the previous xxx xxx series or on x or x platforms the famous enhanced turbo boost option is not implemented here but it stops at  gigahertz however i dont think it could change that much in gaming given several comparative videos even with i and i of the same series and the fps are practically the same which leaves a lot of questions about whether or not to spend  times as much to get little or nothing more always remaining in the gaming field processors with more threads will certainly make a difference in productivity
the cpu is exactly as described and in the quality as expected from intel very good
came in with broken fans on delivery
i really liked it it arrived extremely fast now just test d
used for gaming and nothing to report runs like a clock  crashes
i would say that there has not been much progress in front of my old i f but hey its great for a basicmedium gaming pc it comes with a new newly designed intel heatsink i hope its to compete with amd and not because the temperatures are higher than those of my old f this remains to be seen
i really liked that they delivered it with care and it was on time that was the most important part so it was timely and they delivered it with less than a day i like the quality but cant say its the best    i hope it came with a cooler for all this money tho cuz i aint keeping this if it didnt i legit spent  quid on this over that so hopefully it did
the need to buy a cheap beautiful and qualityprice processor when i paid for it it came to me with super luxury now i use it with good savings and  and up ha
 its spinning
everything arrived fine im still going to test if it works i bought it yesterday it arrived today
was going for a top end p build and from all the reviews id read the f seemed like the best option easy to instal came with a cooling fan although i chose to use a bigger air cooler
no doubt th gen intel processors are a marvel of computing technology although there is a continuing tug of war between intel and amd in this regard i personally chose intel core i k with inbuilt uhd graphics for my newly built desktop pc for those who dont want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards this processor is a very good alternative it can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of blender easily with its unlocked overclocking obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard ie presently available z chipset motherboards it can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of adobe lightroom and photoshop with no hiccups not to mention the support of k video with hdr if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your pc i would suggest this th gen i to those who want to use their pc for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money compared to th gen i which would ideally be the best anyway but costlier too the price is still at a high level hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of intels th gen processors
i have paired this processor with asus prime za motherboard and g mhz ddr ram my usage is mostly for adobe suite for k video rendering  photoediting without dedicated egpu and ocassonal aaa title gaming like gta battlefield cpunketcthe processor works like a charm for rendering and games upto hz in p ultra settingoverall good processor for the price and more review to come in future edits
excellent processor mounted on the pc perfectly smooth it holds up very well to simple games even without a video card
working well stable and can be overclock  with correct cooling setup good price too
good value purchase to build a system
 is what is expected from its specifications
 the time of buying it i had doubts about whether it would arrive very badly treated since it is imported from amazon usa but it came in excellent condition they met the delivery time and i had absolutely no problems with shipping or delivery besides that it is at a lower price than the rest i highly recommend it especially for people like me who are building their first gamer and work pc and are looking piece by piece
amazing cpu previously had a i f so for me it was an extreme upgrade extra more stable fps in pretty much all my games can also tune with intel xtu which is a good feature to have
its very fast but it heats up a lot it even uses w in a stress test before buying try to find out on the forums about this issue no matter what cooler and thermal paste you use it will get very hot the only solution is to make a slight undervolt or lower the loadline calibration in the bios it reminded me of the ik that suffered from the same problem
 with intel its very good the performance is just incredible with the native boost i managed to oc up to ghz and im sure that we can go up again with a custom water the only flaw is that very quickly when you take a  he sticks his tongue out a bit in k i will have to change it after  years because of bottleneck but on a configuration with a  ti it must be a very good synergy very good on processor tasks too to use it to do a bit of rendering the performance is really good
it was too high spec for me
i upgraded to this cpu after some heavy research asking reddit both intel and amd subreddits weighing in money vs performance gained i have used amd since i was a teen and started building computers the conclusion is this it is an amazing cpu runs faster and cooler than my ryzen   the price and performance vs amd also including a board was better than if i had went with a ryzen  xsome background information i wanted to upgrade after receiving an amazon gift card i have never ordered computer parts from amazon though i upgraded from a ryzen   with an asus xf board i really wanted to upgrade and was sad also that windows  did not support my cpu i will give it to microsoft for this as it made a lot of people upgrade their entire computers all for basically the same os as of now with newer looks and not much done under the hood except for th gen intel so good news there too sadly my old board still doesnt support the ryzen   series and only the  series they are working on a bios apparently for the  series because of people who were in my shoes i first almost ordered the ryzen  xt for  after a couple hours of research asking and thinking about it i cancelled that order thankfully and thought well if i am going to spend this much on upgrading my cpu i might as well go all inspend a little more for something better as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile i was then going to get the ryzen  x with an asus board there lied a problem of price i could not find a board and get that cpu still within my budget atleast not a board that wasnt worse than the one i had in ways i mentioned i had posted on the amd subreddit and even they suggested i go intel intel is just killing it as of now hands down although i am sure amd will retaliate i ended up getting the msi za ddr i wish i had the money for ddr ram i would have went with the ddr version as it was basically the same price i had a lot of second thoughts on this board though as it just didnt seem premium as the one i had i am going to do a whole review on it after this ill save my pros  cons for there this cpu also autoclocks itself up or down depending on the load saw it clock down to ghz although not for long for example if not much processing power is warranted which makes sense and i wish everything did so if idling it will clock down and save powerheatand therefore longevity is increased i absolutely love this cpu coming from amd anywaysif you have a corsair hi rgb platinum or similar cooler already the included  screws work just fine with the  socket and this cpu even though you are supposed to get the  kitscrews for this cpu which i did but they are taking forever to ship so i googled and someone said using the  screws will work just fine i get better temps than my ryzen   i can even overclock even more but have no need and no pointtldrupgraded from ryzen   asus rog strix xf gamingupgraded to ik msi za ddrparts kept xgb gb ddr cl mhz ram with xmp docp rtx  the ram works great with this cpu as well although it technically latency wise runs at t on intel instead of t on amd runs slower than when on amd amds infinity fabric but obviously whatever intel is doing makes up for that and therefore my ram either runs fasterthe samepros it is an amazing cpu for price vs performance the ik is good as well i almost just went with it and you would be fine going with it for gaming as even it still has more cores technically than the ryzen  x it also beats the x even though this cpu is supposed to be its comparison rival brother this cpu has cool temps on my corsair hi rgb platinum cooler and the pe core structure are really cool and fun to watch when doing tasksgaming it shipped fastcons literally none with the cpu itself just with shipping  it shipped really fast was here in  days after purchasing on here the biggest complaint i have is amazons shipping so be aware of this i have never ordered computer parts from amazon and have always used newegg they just left the cpu in my mailbox and if it werent for me looking at my cameras and looking out for this part it would have sat in the mailbox all day my mailbox sadly is not very weather proof as well and if it had been raining it wouldnt have been good although it did come in a big box around it the cpu also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box not held into the front windowi hope this review helps people
so everything is good
big improvement going from  cores to  cores too bad about the price though its unlocked and ive got it running at plus  percent i guess i just verbally kissed my warranty goodbye
 cpu is quite old so i upgraded it for the first time in  years at first i was hesitant about ryzen but as a result i decided to buy this one i was very satisfied with the results and as a result of running the same game as  my friends similar ryzen cpu my pc won  laughs
 arrive in perfect condition highly recommended
basic processor used from my home pc does exactly what was requested and ordered
big upgrade from my  years old k
for my needs its the perfect bang for the buck balance between performance and price
so being an amd fanboy i was not keen on getting this but the ct cores to threads kinda caught my eye running  cores and  threads  ecores i think i thought well for the price it should be okayi was wrongthis cpu is a monster in my eyes running with gb of ram ddr and matched with the rtx  gpu being cooled by the artic liquid freezer ii there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max i would recommend this piece of kit to anyone starting out or continuing on with building computers for their high end gaming etc i have not once seen this struggle
this cpu is very powerful and can run games when paired with a good graphics card up to  fps without any problems or stutters make sure that you keep it cooled with a good cooler as well it is also a great price for the product you are getting
 best buyclassic intel midrange cpu for gaming and productivity perfect packaging and no installation problems given the latest releases of th generation intel cpus the price should be around   to become a best buy
relatively fast delivery and processor delivered new
tgood processor but it also costs its money sometimes causes bobbin squeaks for me otherwise a good product
excellent cpu and great value
if youre not going next gen this is your best option great price and amazing performance both in gaming and productivity
does exactly what its supposed to do my computer works great
 just dont understand why im sent a broken cpu thats just unnecessary and timeconsuming
great cpu put it in a new personal gaming rig and it hits ghz out of the box no tweaking and runs stable as can be very happy
okeverything ok
 works perfectly i notice the difference since i come from an eighthgeneration i and now with a  gpu i will have more experience in this regard
good
water coolingnothing to complain about and it does not heat up c at rest even without water cooling
performentperform
intel cpu is good
 i attach it to a new motherboard and start it up is there a red light at the cpu of the led on the motherboard is it broken
 fast and efficient processor combined with a good graphics card is a wonder
super
fast and nice good shopping experience for me
the intel core ik has significantly enhanced my gaming and productivity experience this processor combines raw power with excellent integrated graphics making it an ideal choice for both gamers and professionals
 its job perfectly
 arrived on time and the product is very powerful one of the best processors at the moment perfect for todays games which are often cpubound
  de higher than the i by
this is my first intel build coming from past amd builds ryzen fx athlon phenom i am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this cpu with instructions followed this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least  i overclocked this via the motherboardbios settings and it stays cool with a  fan cooler dont get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate windows experience rating is a  so that says it all if you have the extra  go with the i i should have done that amd seems to be all the hype but i see why intel wont be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip
 very good product i use it for software development and the truth is that the computer is very fast even though i occupy docker
 a big step forward from intel the processor is really good park in consumption powerful in both single and multicore and does not heat excessively if youre looking at it here youve probably already seen countless benchmarks on the web so its useless to post them like all the components of a pc it must be contextualized with respect to the use that a person has to make of it personally i recommend buying
no comentoi dont comment
 recommended seller
 i k th gen who had done his job for the new i k and its day and night paired with an asus rog strix z cm and rog ryujin ii  cooling it meets my expectations i hesitated between the i k and this one i do not regret my purchase on the amazon side nothing to say ordered on tuesday for a reception  hours later on thursday
the one i bought one year ago had instability didnt know it was the cpu until it really started acting up had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the cpu when i reached out to intel they informed me about a policy about tray processor and boxed processor basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they dont cover warranty as for boxed processor they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more fortunatly the one i got was a boxed one but still intel told me i had a tray processor i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a box processor it was a bit unnerving but at the en they offered me the warranty and im supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them
got it as an upgrade over my old k and this is a huge upgrade i do recommend installing a contact frame such as the thermalright for this cpu
got it the next day as stated and was exactly as advertised yes would buy from again

 is great i use the pc for streaming and gaming and it does its job without problems but when i bought it it had risen far too much in price compared to other processors and in qualityprice it works great at the moment in use for a month
 it works well with enough hearts and lanes to have fun on virtual machines but i who keep my computer constantly on inactive but with chrome open and about thirty tabs some of which refresh themselves i have increased my consumption well compared to my previous k the turbo at a little over ghz is funny but it doubles the consumption and therefore the temperature it works well but it heats up severely when it activates the turbo and if you try to ventilate properly the slightest spike gets along
just be sure to match up the chip correctly on the socket one corner has a triangle cutouteasy to installruns smooth and is not a power hog or a supernova in terms of heateven at load it performs wellperfect for gaming no issues in keeping up with gpu
quality product planned the purchase for the configuration of a new pc very satisfied with the purchase and delivery time
the best of the last three generations of intel a decent tdp i havent had temperature problems or any problems i recommend it
p problem during assembly i mounted a noctua nhua cooler when the proc is working at  it stays below  c in normal operation the whole is silent be careful if the cm works on ddr its  times the price of ddr the gpu works well video processing while waiting for the graphics cards to come back at reasonable prices
good enough for this price range
i like the integrated graphics as im not using it for highend gaming i was disappointment to find it didnt come with a cooler ive been spoiled by amd also it was difficult to fit it into the socket to the point that i was worried about damaging it things worked out in the end and i have no complaints about its operation now three months in no problems
runs microsoft flight simulator on multiple  screens beautifully
i heard good things about this cpu and went for it budget friendly and a very good cpu
great productbrand intel i cpu i have been using the intel brand cpus and have been using the i and the k series since they were introduced this seems to handle video processing and cadcam projects quite well i have always had great luck with intel brand processors and will continue using them pretty good value for the cost
i upgraded from the i k to the i  and saw a great performance increase i was eager to test ddr however  i also wanted to experiment with  core processors fortunately i found this i k when the price dropped to  i wasnt sure if it would be a big increase from the i and the i k but the i k is a ferocious beast that has crushed all tasks ive given it and brought immesnse life back to my rtx  super and it stays cools  fluentz auros elite axi k overclocked pcores  ghz ecores  ghz c during multi intensive tasks and games for long periods of timertx  super bg ddrcorsair vengeance mhz ddrcyberpunk  fps  ultrapsycho with medium ray tracing with a low of starfield   p fps high settings the devs need to optimize thoughhorizon zero dawn  fps  ultrashreds through video editing and music editing all at onceamazing at multitaskingpowerfulfastcan be placed in ddr mobos and ddr mobos
compared to the coffee lake generation i had been willingly stuck on for  years this is a massive leap before buying i was a bit skeptical since im not a fan of intels newer way of handling cores but the first thing i tried when i got it was emulating ps games and right off the bat i saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubledthe older cpus from the th th and th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if youre on a budget maybe look on the used market for those but if you really need something powerful this is a good option
this item has been with me for a very short timeso i recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig and after extensive research i made the bold choice to order the intel core ik gaming desktop processor with integrated graphics and  cores let me tell you this processor is the absolute best with its  cores it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience whether im playing graphically demanding aaa titles or indulging in intense multitasking this processor effortlessly handles it all and whats even better is that it comes with integrated graphics meaning i didnt have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card yet the integrated graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups plus with intels reputation for reliable and highquality products i know i can trust the ik to last me for years to comei hope you find this review helpful
the morning after building and setting up windows drivers etc the pc had blue screened because of temperatures and after a reset and entering the bios i saw that the temperature was  degrees celsius thankfully after some trial and error i was able to undervolt it and not have my cpu die id suggest anyone who looks into getting an intel cpu to undervolt it
perfect
exactly what i needed
huge upgrade from th gen i paired it with the asrock z and g ddr
at this time in the product life cycle the th gen cpu is about half the cost of the th gen cpu  it is more than fast enough for everything i do  my major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have tpm   the cpu was easy to install it is running between  degrees celsius though i admit i am not stressing it  i am very happy with my purchase
recib el producto con la prontitud del caso llego sellado y en una caja con otro producto el funcionamiento es bueno y no se suele calentar mucho con un buen sistema de refrigeracin por airei received the product as quickly as possible it comes sealed and in a box with another product the operation is good and it doesnt usually get too hot with a good air cooling system
a great performance cheap enough for the performance it gives i got this for  on bf recommend
usado no trabalhoused at work
this is a very good product and there are no issues with its features and performance the usage process is also very smooth and there hasnt been any overheating so far
this appears to be the best option for intel at this price range works as advertised
its a topoftheline cpu that will last for a long time theres nothing to dislike about itit replaced a  year k
i purchased it at a special price and i havent encountered any issues in terms of usage it offers great value for the money
if youre looking for an intel cpu i would recommend this even though it is a couple years old now i belive its still the best intel cpu for gaming
went from a f to this was a big different on gaming i finally get the fully potencial of my gpu
wow what an incredible black friday deal seriously  is well worth it for the performance i also purchased the k for  which is another unbeatable deal offered this year at amazon if you managed to get your hands on either one of you made the right choice
excellete

great cpu would buy again
its pretty good value for money as far as intel cpus are concerned for a th gen cpu but if youre looking for the better value get the ik which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a th gen cpu the only real downside of the k is that it generally requires a th gen compatible motherboard otherwise youll need to flash the bios on a th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read th gen cpu i highly do not recommend doing this ive tried it a few and its such a big hassle many potential issuesthat i recommend first time pc builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a th gen cpu along with a th gen compatible motherboard dont buy th gen mobo which obviously doesnt require flashing bios for the k to be usable
this is a second purchase of core i  it works very well as expected
so far so good but then thats what i said about the last one  ill check back in a year on this and hope it outlasts my prior cpuas for the last one its intel dropping the ball with their qc it seems  had an imc function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed  couldnt run any xmp profiles and swapping the processor solved it not a mobo issuejust watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen and return it if anything seems even remotely off
for my limited budget i bought it while the k isnt the top of the line at least for me it was more affordable and very performant ive had good success overclocking it and actually undervolting  it to reduce temperatures
the heart of my pc build and wanted to have the k version with the integrated graphics even though i was going to have a gpu anyways its a good backup if the gpu failscant do a pro and con here as there is nothing much to reportit plays every game without bottlenecking my rtx  and was a breeze to install there is literally one way to install it youd have to intentionally or forcibly install it wrongalso it runs surprisingly cool and doesnt act like an easybake oven in my motherboard
ive installed a th gen x th gen and a th gen on my familys pcs ive never had a problem
great cpu for multitasking i dont know too much about cpu but this is great
not much to say about this cpu its intel and these are immortal still have the k i got like  years ago and an extreme i got even earlier than thatso the main motive here is to let amazon know that i have received the item but i dont know how to let them know so they can change the package left at mail to already received
the ik is in the top  for gaming cpus right now amd is doing fairly well as of late but intel has a solid performance lead with its single core performance on newer generation chipsif youre on the fence and want a quick top  for overall gaming performance it goes as follows ik ik ik ik ikthis chip is no slouch though it trades blows with the k in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isnt really fair for comparisonin conclusion if youre looking around this price point check both this cpu and the k pick whichever is cheaper higher end th gen intel motherboards can be flashed in the bios to take th gen cpus too but do your research on those before going that route this one will serve you well
bought this k to have graphics backup the cpu is great the graphics not so much still i do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my pc but only for the purpose of having temporary backup when needed so for that purpose it works the cost vs the kf is fairly negligible so for its primary purpose it is a very good cpu
i got the cpu on sale and i would say the performance is great my application is running smoothly and does not come into any problem for a year now
this thing is a workhorse ive got mine clocked to ghz and it runs like a dream keep in mind this unit will require a water pump air coolers are not enough
its been roughly  years since i last build my gaming computer upgrading to this has been more than significant as of this writing i hope youve done your research the iks price point and its competition for this price point it may be the top dogsome things to consider before purchasing make sure you are purchasing a lga  motherboard i went with the ddr motherboard because ddr is still at its infancy the ddr ram may not be the best option for your buck right now youll be fine with ddr this cpu does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor double check if your psu will be enough there are online resources that will help you calculate your psu its always good to have a little overhead make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws thats compatible with this motherboard you can purchase them separately if you have a heatsink thats very old  its more than likely it may not be compatiblegood luck
bought this for a new personal pc my last was an i k build that got totaled out crushed during shipping after building a new one on a zi platform the performance gain was stunning completely night and day i cannot say enough about this cpu and would totally recommend this product
i had been planning to hold off for raptor lake but my z mobo died and i decided to go ahead and get an alder lake i  so far its impressive  it runs much cooler than my ik mild oc  cc under a gaming load vs c but that couldve been due to the my old aio being in its death throws for the past few months  dmark cpu score went up noticeably as well  overall im pretty happy with it  havent messed around with overclocking yet but there doesnt seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be  from what ive read  ghz is about what you can expect  the days of getting another mhz   ghz  over stock clocks out of a cpu are gone it seems
this processor is absolutely incredible with no doubts the only this you have to keep in mind that go for atleast  aio for more better performance

this is my best buy so far for gaming and editing it runs great whatever you throw excellent performance so far cinebench score is  at  tdpsuggestion buy only if you have very good amount of cooler
good
i bought this to replace my k after i realized how much it was holding back my   i bought an asrock z pg lightning d board to go with it so i could use my existing ddr ram  the difference was night and day  i have an idcooling mm aio cheapest i could find on amazon with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on cinebench r unless i run  or  passes back to back  i am thrilled with how well this cpu runsi was able to bump my ddr up to mhz in gear  timings cl after a bios update from asrock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast  i get an average of  in cinebench r and it will overclock as far as you want  i have taken it to  and it runs fine it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed  im pretty sure i could overclock this beast to the moon if i threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop but it is plenty fast as is  i have no regrets about not bumping up to the k i do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads
upgraded to the k from the k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive this th gen i k is officially intels fourth fastest cpu on paper but in real life its the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it kk and k are all plagued with issues that intel wont discuss but admits to albeit grudgingly until a fixall patch is released the k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who wont be bothered with unpredictable bugs and bsod fests what good is it having a ferrari but with an engine thats goes offline  times a day  may as well go with a porsche that works at that level of performance these highend cpus more or less all perform equal or would if they all worked properly but its easy to understand the frustration of owners whose day window for return to amazon is closed
 original intelwithout cooler without original intel package
rtxtikin combination with the rtxti most current games can be played in k settings it is cooled with simple water cooling but the fan is quiet even during games
i upgraded to this k from an khuge improvement in speed and general pc performance and whilst running msfs and general gamingi water cool so temperature not much over c

excellent performance
this processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old ik according to hwmonitor the cpu package hovers around w power consumption doing desktop tasks web browsing  email  officecompared to my ik video card and psu unchanged new motherboard ram and heatsinkfan system power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about w higher than my k in normal mode or about w lower in eco mode in my motherboards settings synthetic benchmarks dmark cpu profile indicate x performance for singlecore processing and x performance for maximum threads reallife video encoding is roughly x faster using powerdirectornote that this lga socket is known to allow some bending this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling this can be remedied by installing a pressure plate i bought a thermalright lgabcf for around if you dont need a builtin gpu consider the ikf the builtin gpu is nice to have but not always worth the premium if you also dont plan to overclock consider the if
might be overkill for most builds since i k is a very good choice as well
 processor is excellent quite fast for all tasks the only downside so to speak are the temperatures it handles so i recommend pairing it with a good cooling system the sellers service was excellent it made me smile when i saw that the processor was packaged with a pulparindo i would give it another star just for that
ive heard that exhaust heat cannot be fully absorbed when air cooled but exhaust heat is generated normally i dont know if its overloaded as long as you normally use a browser or play games its fine

paste provided by idcooling was not used amazon httpswwwamazoncomgpproductbvdlhmoverall i assume the goal is reached  the presented system can play recent games and look very cool in my humble opinion
the processor is excellent but delivery was desired as it took a long time another detail the box arrived all wrinkled lucky not to have damaged the processor
great cpu worked great out of the box and runs like a dream
has really improved my gaming and streaming services along faster and better than my th gen i
performance per watt and mild heat generation if power is limited it seems like intels power exploded uselessly in order to compete with rival cpus
i arrive quickly it works very well
wow welcome to a real gaming cpu this runs good have not oc stays cool with my aio no stability issues nothing but a great freakn experience very happy with this purchase
ive had this processor  now for about  months ive overclocked the cpu and it performs spectacular this is a powerful chip boots fast and can handle multiple tasks at the same time from recording streaming gaming youtube video rendering and with no loss to performance or heating issues  granted i liquid cool and never exceed c cpu came in perfect condition no bent pins i will say if you can find it for a great price grab one

this is my first upgrade since the ik this processor is a beast eats away at any task i throw at it without a sweat i was a little hesitant with the new cpu designs with the performance and efficiency cores but man the efficiency cores alone kill my k  great cpu just make sure you know these shoot to the sky heat wise when you punch heavy workloads and you will need cooling to match depending of how long and how much you will need to pull away from it
the processor arrived in optimal condition in a timely manner ill update the review once ive properly installed and tested it for the time being i can only comment on the seller who actually shipped in the best and expeditious way
ikit was originally a replacement from the th generation ik performance has been greatly improved im very satisfied  a lot of streaming software etc have been started at the same time but so far there is no such thing as insufficient processing performance however its easy to hold the heat i dont know if air cooling can cool it down i use simple water cooling fyi
i was worried about the top model core ik but i chose this core ik which has the same specs as the number of cores and improved peak performance and watt performance it is operated with a z motherboard but if the bios is compatible there is no particular problem since recent motherboards only need a power supply to update the bios there are many cases where there is no problem even if the bios is not compatible we recommend that you update your device drivers to the latest or download if you are installing a new one beforehand the score of cinebenchr is  in multi and  in single the score has increased by about  from the core ik and the power consumption during full load is about w lower so its a nice feeling compared to nm and current products from other companies i think they are doing well with process rules that are  to  generations down but i think that the evaluation is divided without changing from alder lake that a mm simple watercooled cooler is essential performance per watt at full load is honestly quite subtle the one i installed this time is for a gaming pc so im personally very satisfied because it doesnt let me encode videos if it is the main encoding process i recommend the ryzen  x which is an old model that works without problems with a large air cooled cooler but is easy to handle and is cheaper if youre a game main i recommend the core ik which has high singlethread performance because it has high watt performance and cost performance
this is a great cpu periodhowever get a thermalright contact plate to replace your mobos socket clamp this is a must have item to keep your cpu flat to make proper contact with your cooler its a  dollar part installs in seconds and can lower your temps c easythank me later
it was what i expected the delivery was less than expected and they took the trouble to include a thank you for the purchase excellent service
purchased on sale for  the k is the best value cpu if you require enough speed for highend gaming  productivity eg video editingrendering streaming multitasking etc this thing is fast i was able to undervolt it and overlock it to  ghz all pcore and  ghz all ecores i could go higher if i wanted to spend more time on it but this was a quick overclock perfectly stable and runs relativelycool with the undervolt intel is still my preference for cpus and i dont foresee that changing especially with all of the issues ive read regarding amd chips boot up issues crashes poor multicore performance
i think it is the best processor in generation  because it is less hot and better performing than the previous tricks its disadvantage is  so i put four stars
theth gen far outperforms th while being only marginally beneath th gen for the price there is no competition much cooler than any ryzen with far smoother ingame performance with a  in my experience low s c at idle and never goes over c under full load with a  aio

as soon as it was assembled it became a blue screen due to thermal runaway and in order to pursue current certification there was no improvement at all and as a result of replacing it with the i kf i bought at the same time the cpu was discovered to be the cause and there is no way you can tell right after it arrives and this warranty period is too short and the cpu is cheap          its not there so the replacement is  still a long way off and the days of putting up with it for a while with only a limited number of games that can be made are the worst
really love this processor its really fast using the adobe apps recommended for content creation
it works great with an arous z elite ax motherboard temperatures range between  and  degrees c with cooler master  illusion liquid cooling

overlocking the crap out of this with liquid cooling rock solid  not a blue screen in site dedicate  cores to a vm with no appreciable decline in bare metal os operation temps are higher with the same cooler as compared to k k running c under load this jumps to the c area pretty quick
no surprises here the cpu functions exactly as advertised

put this in a gaming machine and it seems to be handling everything really well so far the price point was right
very good
item as described and works perfectly
good deal and for the delivery
good deal and for the delivery
the highest package temps my cpu gets while running multiple applications is  degrees celsius and thats only for brief moments average    degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background maxes at the  rated watts for me which really is fine average of about  watts and computer overall idles   watts which is  watts less than my old i th gen no need to undervolt this cpu even though you can youll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do during the cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at    degrees celsius but remember thats absolute max mode  of users will never use this cpu for more than several minutes at if intels extreme tuning utility does not automatically download when installing definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it it is easy to use and you wont regret it i just use it for monitoring performance but you can use it for easy optimize and underovervolt with too but id recommend doing any of that through your motherboard bios if you decide to most new bioss are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway do your research on which to use and how long story short if you want max performance to play around with just get a i processor thats what those are made for for everyone else theres this one
i am a team blue guy and i think this is a great cpu for the money currently running at  and very stable

my previous build had an ik and after  years of abuse i decided to upgrade in this new build to an ik and im not disappointed  its a great cpu and is handling everything i throw at it  stays cool even without a fancy aio  liquid cooling setup  during the process of installing the cpu on the socket it fell into place perfectly but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the cpu into the socket it did feel i had to put a bit more force than i would have thought necessary but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues  highly recommendedcomplete parts listmsi mag z tomahawk wifi lga  atx motherboard httpswwwneweggcompneitemnecable matters pack  way  pin pwm fan splitter httpswwwamazoncomdpbpxlhnzpscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailsarctic mx thermal paste httpswwwamazoncomdpbdppscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailscablemod cseries classic modmesh sleeved cable kit httpswwwamazoncomdpbhmjgnjpscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailsx corsair vengeance ddr ram mhz cl httpswwwamazoncomdpbwhxmpscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailsasus dual geforce rtx  white oc gb ddrx httpswwwamazoncomdpbcbzzwjmpscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailsnzxt h flow dualchamber midtower httpswwwamazoncomdpbbggqkkypscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailsx corsair ll rgb triple pack httpswwwamazoncomdpblfbypscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailsintel ik core httpswwwamazoncomdpbbcfflpscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailscorsair rmx full modular atx psu httpswwwamazoncomdpbrjptmzpscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailsrocketek pin usb header splitter httpswwwamazoncomdpbkvhtpscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailsdeepcool ak cpu cooler httpswwwamazoncomdpbpcwksppscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetailssamsung  evo plus tb nvme m ssd httpswwwamazoncomdpbmfzyfpscrefppxyoovdtbproductdetails
a very good midrange processor ive use one for years and it has always worked well for me
the media could not be loadedtemp idle sunder load low s radiators
i got this cpu to upgrade from my th gen ikf processor temps are a slight bit toasty compared to my th gen cpu but pairs real well with my  ti
the media could not be loadedreplacement from the core ikf booted right away all cores shown  while undercooked works perfectly baby in the background couldnt believe it thank you amazon for coming through once again with a formidable solution paid the extra  to make sure the problem of the i did not continue to occur problem solved
nice  i upgraded from an amd ryzen  x to this cpu and the components below and i couldnt be happier  everything opens almost instantly whether it be windows s file explorer edge browser and webpages and opening files in general  i upgraded primarily because i am a developer and visual studio  dotfuscator would take almost  minutes to compile and obfuscate my largest program on my old build  after upgrading it now compiles in about  mins  seconds  the longest part is dotfuscator not visual studio compiling  compiling happens in seconds on this setupmy componentsmsi mpg z carbon wifi gaming motherboard intel core ik desktop processorthis cpucorsair vengeance ddr ram gb xgb mhz msi mpg ag pcie   atx  gaming power supply  full modular   plus gold certified w corsair mp tb pcie gen x nvme  m ssd cooler master hyper  halo white cpu air cooler msi gaming geforce rtx  ti graphics cardi dont game much but there is a noticeable difference loading and playing cities skylines after upgrading tooi am very happy with the new pc  everything runs smoothly i havent had a single crash running the xmp profile in bios for my ram so it runs at full speeds  this cpu blows the ryzen  x out of the water  check out the userbenchmark amd ryzen  x vs intel core ik comparison on userbenchmarks website for details which is what i did before purchase  it lives up to the benchmarks for me
after too many years of gaming on an old ik i finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year  i purchased the most up to date cpu and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did overall i think this is a great cpu however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things intel just keeps pushing these cpus harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of amd but in the process they are making cpus that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool after a lot of tweaking in the bios i finally got this one to stay below the  degree celsius threshold but that doesnt account for how hot it still makes my room when im gaming the extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months but as summer is approaching im wondering how this is going to pan outanyway the cpu is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box i didnt run into any errors or issues with this cpu overall i  recommend it because intel has never let me down ive been building my own systems for more than  years now too so thats a pretty long track record of cpus that just worked and never died because of that i can easily recommend this cpu and i would definitely order it again
i had a ryzen  xt cpu for a while now so i went for a new upgrade and went for intel for this generation this processor works faster and better compared to what i had previously this cpu is basicaly like an efficient i k so if your looking for a high end processor just get this th gen also at this time the th gen i just got released but based on the reviews its more like a th gen intel ks proccesor that why i never went that route
just what i needed  it is fast and its not annoying used it for a small rig
im very happy with this processor
i built a new computer during the height of covid dummy i know right and decided on a ik im a sysadmin by trade so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processorbut for gamingtitles like cyberpunk days gone to even wowthere were areas that my  was being bottlenecked by the ki coupled this cpu with a msi edge z ddr i have fantastic samsung bdie cl  ddr from the previous build so far in cyberpunk im seeing  more fps on p ultra settings w raytraycing on high wow is getting  more fps and im getting over  fps in valdrakken where i was getting  fps with the k with the same settings as cyberpunk p ultra  graphics settingsim using the corsair icue hi elite lcd mm aio with thermal grizzly kryonaut extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy and even at prolonged sessions in cyberpunk my temps are not getting above c and no i have not done the contact plate modtldr  this cpu is blazing fast and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade i dont claim to be steve from gamers nexus or a pro cpu tester  but i can tell you that this thing is amazing and will serve you well for years to come
i was close to give them a bad review but then i found out usps was the problem with my delivery  if possible find another shipping method to avoid delays  product exactly as described much needed now i can finish building my pc thank you
spend the money once and get a good processor you wont regret
the ik has ik performance at an i range price range please note i used an older z evga classified board i was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new cpu yet i suggest people who used a th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboards vendor manual the installation was incredibly easy and i booted the bios after the bios update without any problem i had hit  ghz on the cpu without overclocking it also supported  mhz ddr ram without any issues after enabling xmp the reasonable pricing for z or z boards makes the ik a good combo compared to amds expensive ryzen  cpus and motherboard costs for people who are still on older generations the vast e cores and p cores offered by intels th gen make it worth it to accomplish cpuintensive tasks like handbrake or adobe premiere this cpu runs cool with a  mm aio and a high airflow case around  c idle temperature for me i also like to note the cpu fits only fits one way and the cpu lever has a bit of tension so dont be afraid when installing your cpu
without a doubt good cpu stays cool over clocked at  c runs good worth the money
spectacularfast delivery the product met all expectations its a very fast processor in my case i use it for graphic design in short its spectacular
i had a  year old acer tc desk top with an i cpu due to not able to upgrade to windows  and microsoft scheduled to stop supporting windows  october   i gave myself a year to shop for a new pc knowing black fridaycyber monday have the best prices and deals  i like the gaming rgb astatic and after months of researching online i decided i was going to build my next pc  black friday came early this year thanks to prime day and  msi mag z tomahawk mb  and v color ddr oc mhz g ram and msi rtx gpu and the intel ik  all powered from a gamemax w psu  i have a brand new powerful gaming pc that will serve me well in the years to come
paired with my ti founders edition i have yet to run a game that seems like this combo couldnt handle apart from gaming it can handle multiple instances of tasks and run them all seamlessly this is the most powerful cpu ive had but it still impresses me how fast everything is and i have not seen its limits yet
the second purchase of the product met its characteristics
i got this for a new system build even though a little higher than i like to spend but it has performed greatafter i noticed a drop in performance and doing research i found out that these run very very hot and the thermal protection had kicked in to throttle the processor down i tried a few air cooled options that did the trick but they were too loud for me so i ended up with a liquid cooled option which is what i would recommend to anyone using this processor currently my idle temps are around c and at  utilization temps average around  with a quick peak of  i dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons but i did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what i did th gen blows away th gen this i even bests the i th gen great chip as long as you keep it cool
im sure the chip works beautifully but i had no idea the k series didnt come with a cooler which is very upsetting for the price point i now realize very small at the bottom of description it says no thermal cooling wish it said that in the main details
fast cpu did not come with a cpu cooler make sure you get agood cpu cooler if you play games this cpu runs very hotif you max it out recommend water cooler or large air cooled
the i runs a bit hotter than the th gen i but i just couldnt resist spending a bit more for those extra cores as of  its a razorfast cpu for the average buyer  probably too powerful for anyone but powerusers and videoeditors as for gaming itll run many older games at a high fps even without any help from a gpu and it handles modern titles without any problems tooit can run with a lowpower or stockquality cooler for daily tasks but id recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavyduty loads at it or goodperformance air cooling if youre planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future
i love this chip fast and efficient also stays cool with my mm aio  i had to replace my mb and intel i th gen k so got this over the i and could not be happier  wish intel would drop their prices but it is a value for what you get
nothing to say all is okay
running in xmp mode all cores synced with ram clocked at mhz no problems whatsoever runs fast and cool compared to my old k
i wanted speed without breaking the bank and this cpu fits the bill runs a little hot but not too much to handle with an aio water cooler i use a deepcool lt pleased with my build
its great just buy it or the k
great value for my gaming pc d
if you are looking to get the best gaming experience with the decent price and not getting poor processing power this is your option you get the flagship power with lower price than competitorit is usually huge amount of power however in load but for person like me keeping oc most of the time this is where e cores getting into the playim not intel fan anymore i wanted to get amd but because amd requires ddr and much expensive for no payback compared to intel i did choose this and im not regretting itso tldr if you are short in budget and want something last long for next years get this one fore sure
above are screenshots of my passmark benchmark both systems exactly the same except the first picture has the k and the second picture has the k in it the rest of the components are hx asus rog maximus hero z gskill trident ddr f mhz adata legend  ssd  x set up in raid  vetroo lurker mm aio water cooling power color rx  xt i run all p cores synced at  mhz temps idle at about  to c hard benchmarking takes it up as high as  c once typically about c ordinary gaming tasking takes it to about  to cif you are wondering if its worth the upgrade it is but considering that my system is one of the fastest in the world with these components i would have to say that upgrading to a z motherboard is not worth it if you already have a zthat is all and good day to you
absolutely great cpu fast efficient and perfect for gaming its the ideal cpu for gamers especially coming from a k i noticed drastic improvements in my gaming and i highly recommend for others great buy
i replaced a th generation i cpu with this one  the difference in performance is dramatic although i the also replaced the mobo which contributed to the improvement  i may have bought too much cpu power  the asus diagnostics that i run show that the cpu rarely runs at more than  of capacity although i also installed a new gpu so most of the graphics processing is offloadedinstallation in the asus motherboard was straightforward although the socket size has changed from my previous intel cpu and i had to purchase a new mounting bracket for my cooler which i did not replace
very impressive cpu almost on par with the i just slightly fewer ecores which if your not an editor or creator of some sort you really wont miss them gaming wise this cpu has hit all my benchmarks with a solid score on cinebench time after time runs a little hot while gaming among other things roughly around  to c at highest times but with the right cooler you will be impressed does not come with stock cooler would recommend
open boxused good condition item purchased for my wifes latest build wound up having a better memory controller than my old ks  runs reeeeally cool
Best budget processor 12th gen
"Paired with 8 gb ram, H610M-E D4 Intel Lga 1700 Mic-ATX Motherboard, Western Digital WD Green SN350 NVMe 240GB, Upto 2400MB/s, and working fine. Go for it."
"Best processor you could find under 8k , it beats most processors which are more expensive than this one.. overall great for gaming in this price range"
Okay

The processor works with MSI H610M-B DDR4 Micro-ATX out of the box. The processor comes with a heatsink with fan and thermal paste is also present under the heatsink. No need to buy thermal paste.
Working fine and great performance ð
"My last I3 was the gen 9, so jumping to 12 and seeing that its a PINLESS CPU (pins are on the motherboard) was a big surprise and a bit of a relief. Overall I am damned happy with the upgrade, its not a top end gaming PC but its more than enough. I don't do competitive FPS games, RTX lighting is obnoxious as well as motion blur - basically purty graphics and good performance is what matters.That said the one complaint I do have falls on Amazon. You'd think that a processor would be packaged in a box with some protective wrapping right? Nope. Paper bag with no bubble wrap that also arrived torn. The fact that the RAM didn't fall out the hole and that the CPU works fine is a relief."
Really good for budget builds
Best budget cpu for Esport game
"Absolute beast for Â£100 that competes well and can perform along side even a 3060ti or rx 6700xt, only thing iâd say is use your own thermal paste, the paste that comes with the fan is sub par"
"I'm sure I'm stealing someone else description, but it is such a great entry level CPU.I'm just using it for gaming, which an RX 6600 XT, and not had any CPU bottlenecking at all.The chip runs light on power, temps have been fine, way less than than I used to get on an i5 in the laptop.I'm only running 1 fan on the case, and the room can often get to 26-28 C in summer, but thermals are still great.Very happy, and would highly recommend.Also Amazon was super quick on delivery!"
Works as expected!!!
"I used this to build a pc for my wife. The performance on this CPU (depending on supporting hardware) matches or exceeds many CPUs available at both similar and higher price points. If you are truly going for a budget build, it is hard to beat this below $100.I built her system with 16GB of DDR4 3200 ram, and an RX 6600 for the GPU, and she has no problem running anything either gaming or productivity.I donât recommend going as cheap as you can on the motherboard, if you get this though. The performance on this can be great but you have to get supporting hardware to maximize it."
"This is probably the best value cpu a budget build could have. If your budget is around 800-1000 usd get this cpu. I donât care where you get this from, but I got this product in very good shape and the packaging was great. So you can buy from them but you can get this from anyone I guarantee it is great cpu to build you pc around."
This CPU is probably one the best budgie CPUS that money can buy
Very good performance vs price ratio. Hard to find something better
Good little Cpu
Getting over 100fps and even 150fps in some cases with a 6600XT OC (while keeping VRAM usage under 6gb of course) on new games.This is a great CPU if you're on a budget
"Sure you can pay more to get a cpu thatâs better at complex tasks like video editing, but for more gaming this is able to carry even a midrange gpu easily.Itâs very low cost too."
"This cpu is part of my upgrade from socket 1200 to socket 1700. This cpu is noticeably faster than the one it replaced, a 10th generation Intel i5. This cpu runs very cool and provides plenty of power for my everyday computing needs, which do not include gaming. My system currently runs the Zorin OS (Linux) smoothly and efficiently with temperatures sometimes under 30 degrees. Just remember that with this cpu you need a graphics card as the chip does not have that component. It is a nice touch that this cpu is compatible with either DDR4 or DDR5 memory. Just check the standards for the motherboard you intend to purchase. Best of luck with building your own desktop."
good
"If you're building a PC on a budget, and don't want to go with AMD, this isn't a bad option. Will play optimized AAA titles just fine, but I would recommend this to more of an e-sports gamer or someone who enjoys older titles. If you're in the market for a streaming system or a media center, AMD has much better offerings."
Very nice CPU for light gaming! However the packaging it came with was terrible they just threw it on a plastic bag and ship it. This is unacceptable!
Its a damn good budget CPU. Great for 1080p -1440p gaming and everyday use with low power draw and heat output. No IGPU so you'll need a GPU of some kind in your build but that's about it
"I bought this cause I didnât want something too expensive and this price was good for me so i went ahead and got it. its great for what i use it for, works very well in my PC setup"
"I loved the i3-12100f because it is very cheap, but performs and likely wont bottleneck any of your GPUs (Unless your using a 4090 or sum). I saw fps numbers well above the hundred mark when playing many triple A titles, and it can go over 2 to even 3 hundred fps on esport titles. I paired it with a 6650xt"
"My oldest ordered this for a PC he built on hiw own, with all the parts needed. He happy with it"
Works like a charm. For all my Steam Games it works very well. Did some benchmarking and got very decent numbers. I used it with 16 MB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM and an RTX 2060 I had lying around. Used Valley and Supposition with VSYNC on for 1080P and had solid 60 FPS. VSYNC off got 80 to 100 FPS. CPU usage was never above 25 percent.
"We only bought this to update BIOS on a new motherboard in order to use a newer CPU.  This lil guy was a perfect solution to not further cripple our collective wallets, and we got the update run at long last!  And now we have a spare CPU in case disaster strikes... again."
"Bought as a test CPU to see if motherboard was working, didn't use long, but seemed to be a good sub-$100 option."
"Performs as expected, but you do need a GPU for video output. Just spend the $30 for the iGPU (i-3 12100) version (works great as a Plex/Emby/Jellyfin/etc media server)."
works well for low end gaming pc if paired with a 6650 for me love it
"I didnt expect much from an i3, but once again I was blinded by the label. This product holds the price to performance of a console KILLER. It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc.I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance.Overall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing. DONT BE BLINDED BY THE I3 LABEL, IT PERFORMS UP THERE WITH RYZEN CPUS AND 10TH GEN I7S!!!"
for the money not bad for basic home computing starter CPU just wait and later buy an i9 14th gen CPU they kick asssss.
"all good, im using this pc now... for once the pc is working"
"If your on a price crunch i highly recommend this processor. It will eat just about any game, but dont expect 19 performance"
"Bought this for my modernity pack coming from an AMD hex-core. This little quad core slaps the FX series around in almost very manner, including lower power consumption. Pair this with a decent MoBo and RAM, and you have a great foundation. My only complaint, and it's small, but they don't include any thermal paste in the box, but meh."
Good enough to game with and under 100$
Great performance for the price. Cooler it comes with is great.
"Really great CPU, budget friendly. I recently build my pc and paired with rx 6600"
good
Good if you doing light work or no serious gaming. I returned and went with a 5600x
"This has enough power to play ALL games.  I don't have a single one in my library that uses more than 50% of this CPU.  It plays GTA 5, satisfactory, far cry 6, cities skylines, and it can even play UEBS 2 with 4 million A.I. enemies.  I've only ever seen this hit 100% on benchmarks.Just because it's an i3, don't think it's weak.  12th gen i3's are more powerful than i7's of older generations.Don't buy the i5, i7, or i9.  This is more than enough.Update 5-25-2024This processor is still going strong and can still play modern games.  Runs sons of the forest like a champ never hitting 100%.  Unfortunately I have found 2 games this struggles to run.  Star citizen and grey zone warfare.  It is 100% the entire time on both of these games.  Grey zone warfare can still run at 80fps on ultra settings at 4k, but Star citizen bogs down so bad it's almost unplayable.  But still, even in 2024 it's still a great buy and I still recommend."
"Normally I buy i7 processor machines, but I bought three of these for some basic gaming machines and they work great. Good benchmarks, no issues with gaming."
The price this little quad core comes in at really is incredible. Sure it's quad core but this is not the i3 of the past (well kinda is but you know what I mean). 4.3ghz single core with 8 threads means this think is a mini gaming beast. It can do 1440p gaming (with capable card of course) and I have been doing just that. The only reason I will be moving on from it is for the 6 core i3 in 14th gen. Best believe though I will be making another inexpensive PC with this when I upgrade. I have a spare 5500xt that should make for a quality 1080p second machine for when I visit home to my mom's. 5/5 stars.
"Amazing cpu for less then 100$. I put this into my build and it is VERY fast. I can play any game with no issues paired with Rx 6600. I would recommend upgrading to a better cpu in a year or 2 like a 12400F, but it isnât necessary. If u are building a budget build then this is an awesome choice tho it will slowdown on you in a year or 2 so thatâs why Iâm gonna upgrade to 12400F soon"
Insane cpu for budget builds
Good processor for office and games
"the i3-10100fâs main flaw was the small cache size of 6moâ¦ this one has 12moâ¦ which is a massive uplift in stability when gamingâ¦ and speaking of gamingâ¦. the cooler it comes with ( idk why but one of the 4 push pins never wanted to be fully pushed ) wellâ¦ playing gta 5 at 120fps led me to 85-92 degrees on the cpuâ¦â¦ sorry but this is not a laptop, this is unacceptableâ¦â¦â¦â¦..get ready for a cooler upgrade, i canât believe they even give this but twice bigger for the i9âsâ¦ oofâ¦. struggling under 35w load, thatâs pathetic"
"This CPU comes with a cooler and a diagram showing how to attach said cooler. However the diagram showed use of a bracket on the motherboard and it did not have one in the box. Luckily I planned on using my own cooler anyways, however I can't overlook that as it would be frustrating to anyone relying on their box cooler to be ready to go"
"It came inside an Amazon bag, so the box bumped a little, as can be seen. Works great for gaming and office work as well, paired with a fast SSD and nice RAM sticks."
Works great
"I have this installed in an ASUS PRIME PLUS-D4 with an M.2 970 EVO Pro 1TB, ZOTAC 2080, 32GB VulcanC DDR4, AZZA Spectra 280 case with 7 fans.  Running 1080P maxed out CyberPunk 2077 @ 57-60fps WHILE streaming was more than I thought this 'lil dude could handle. Third day stock cooler couldn't keep up so I threw in a Deepcool cooler in there! Never goes above 70C now.... Love this build :)"
numeric calculations
"It is exactly what it shows and described on the promo. Works like a charm. I'm even surprised myself of how great is performing in my system. Comes with the whole shebang ready to install and also comes ready to install on the motherboard (Silver Thermal Grease CPU Heatsink Compound Paste). No need to put anything, just peel off the plastic and install... Awesome."
"Itâs an intel processor, itâs gonna work, and itâs gonna work as expected. Good product, package was fairly banged up and the cpu is shipped visible at the top of the box standard from intel, I was lucky the cpu didnât get damaged, cause the box sure did"
"If you look you will see this but I didnât expect this processor to lack onboard graphics, just leaving this review so others know."
Plan on buying a separate cpu cooler because the one that was included is bad quality and easily broken so unless you are an incredibly careful person order a separate cpu cooler but the cpu is great value for the money
"Iâd like to state that this isnât a high end part. This is an $80 cpu with only 4 cores and 8threads but those are incredibly fast cores and pairing it with an appropriate gpu like the 3060, 6600(xt) and possibly up to the 3070, 6750xt, and 6800xt at 1440p or higher will run those gpus without an issue. Anything higher and youâd already be spending a lot for the rest of the system so just get a better cpu."
CPU is amazing for it's price. Decent performance compared to the predecessors. Pack it with RX 6600 and you will be happy playing your favourite games without hassle.
Works perfect ðð¼
"Iâve paired it with a RX 7600. Works pretty well with it. Iâve not experienced any issues so far.You may push to get a i5-12400F for higher cores if your budget allows it. Otherwise, this is a great starting point for a budget PC build."
Perfect for me!
"Little i5 13th Gen CPU, BIG PERFORMANCE!!!Went from a i5 10400 to this BEAST!!!!Had only 6 cores, now I have 14 Cores and 20 Threads!!!MAN!  This packs a BIG PUNCH!I can't believe it works so well!I highly recommend this to anyone who custom-builds computers and gamers/streamers like myself!I don't have any second thoughts about this MONSTER!  Blew my socks off!!"

Great performance
"I'm working on upgrading my current build and this was just the thing I needed. So many games run so smoothly with this and it's hard to beat. It hasn't thermal throttled, and I'm sure that's because the stock cooler does the job just fine. It works perfect with a 650 watt 80+ bronze PSU. Do recommend for any mid to high range builds."

"Hello,So I bought this processor to replace my ryzen 7 2700x that finally decided to die on me. I have had the ryzen since launch.I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender. Or in zbrush, maya, 3ds max, or substance painter."
"I build PCs for clients daily. The core i3-13100 is absolutely perfect.  6 core 12 thread, nothing can beat it for the money. And the client is very happy with its performance.  Can run many different programs at once.The core i3 has changed alot over the years. Used to be dual core, with HT, then quad core not HT, now 6 core 12 thread. Much better value.  Maybe for the 14th gen core i3 they could include 6 P-cores, 2 E-cores, being the same 12 thread CPU,"
This is a Great entry level processor that works like a more expensive processor!  Makes an excellent first computer!
"Wow this thing is fast. Intel has done an amazing job with the 13th gen. I'm using it on my dev machine and the vs code / node.js / react environment starts up lightning fast. And with 6+4 cores, there's plenty of room left for background tasks (docker containers!). And I'm still amazed at how affordable such a powerhouse processor is. I literally don't need to go i7 or i9. Love the competition AMD and Intel are still having and am happy to have a processor split household :)"
"Use in a new build with a Rog Strix Z690-E motherboard, 32gigs of DDR-5 6400 ram and a 1 tb Samsung 980 pro  NVMe pcie ssd.Fast cpu with low power consumption, 65w, and very low temps.I was able to fit my 10 years old Corsair H60 water cooling system on it and to my surprise, this cpu runs cooler than the i7-2600 cpu the H60 was cooling before. Present temp, writing this review, is 25 celsius. Surfing and watching videos on youtube, temps are around 29-35 celsius. Have not tried the Intel supplied cooler.Granted my gpu is not recent, I have yet to update my gtx 950, encoding video using cpu in handbrake is way faster  than when encoding using the gtx 950 nvenc and the resulting file size are quite smaller for the same visual quality.Encoding  pushes the  cpu and water cooling fans to 100%  and temps climb up to 99 degrees but it all works flawless.Have yet to game with it, will do when I get a new gpu."
Great performance on a budget. Great core for a 1080p/2K gaming machine. Easy to install and no issues with operation.
Paired it with a rtx 3070 and handles everything very well. 40% utilization with full load of GPU. Also great for productivity with 10 cpu cores.
This was a new pull from an unused return which included the stock cooler. The price was the same as the 13400f and roughly $20 more than the 12600 sale price at the time. With an aftermarket air cooler it's not even putting out heat and I've run some CPU intensive tasks and games with performance cores at 4.5.
This CPU is more than enough for any mid-low end PC build and will play well at any game (including AAA games) In fact I think you can definitely save money and go for the 12400f in terms of bang for buck. Loving this CPU and fixed my bottleneck
This CPU was a no-brainer for a budget Gaming PC. Works well and was super easy to install in my Asrock z690 RS.
"20 threads, 30W idle, what else you need?Great CPU for Proxmox sever, tons of power!"
"If you need more processor, buy more processor.  However, most web surfer and video viewers will never notice this is a budget CPU.  Modern tech makes this little guys speedy as heck.  It runs games just fine as long as your expectations aren't super high end 4K gaming at a zillion FPS.  Check youtube for videos.  Great little chip."
This thing is still rated in the top for gaming processors and has served me well over the past few months. Upgrading my video card now to take advantage of this better as it's creating a bottle neck. Handles VR games like a charm and doesn't struggle with anything I've thrown at it!
"The 13100 isn't the powerhouse that the 13900k is, but it works well for day to day task where a more powerful processor isn't required."
Bought this to replace a burned out chip on my old motherboard. Install was easy (so long as you know what you are doing) and only took a few minutes to get my computer up and running again.
"I originally got this cause I wanted to try out Intel's p cores/e cores.  Coming from a long time AMD user, this intrigued me.So far, it's got it's ups and downs.  But it seems to be at par with the Ryzen 7 5700g.  Though better in lots of ways....like, being to use either DDR 4 or 5.  Or PCIe 4 or 5, depending on mother board.  While the Ryzen 7 5700g is stuck at PCIe 3.Anyway, I loved it.  But decided to swap with with a i9 14900k.I donated it to a friend along with a few other parts to upgrade her system from an A10 to this.  So far it's been real good to her.The only odd note about this processor and it's IGPU counterpart is, this one have more cache.  While the IGPU version have less cache.  Try to weigh in your options when looking at this over the other.  I picked this due to a tiny drop in price with the added extra cache.  But, it wouldn't be great for my itx rebuild I did later on.  This low powered CPU (compared to a Ryzen 7 5700g) would benefit with the IGPU when going for a plain HTPC build."
"Plenty fast enough for me, I do some gaming (War Thunder, Cities Skylines, Company of Heroes) and some Stable Diffusion AI artwork and this handles everything.The integrated cooler is small and handles the heat fine, without having to worry about paying for elaborate cooling solutions."
"The box contained everything I needed to install the processor. It was super-easy to install the process in the new build I did, and everything went perfectly. I am not a performance fiend, so I cannot comment on the performance."
"Intel chip arrived open, used with wear marks from being installed and traces of thermal paste. Not what I expected. Unimpressed"
Used it in a fresh build on MSI Mortar wifi and Thermalright assassin x. Temps 3x on idle and 5x on load. Has all needed performance and with integrated graphics is all needed. With Gigabyte Eagle RTX 3060 OC got Fortnite Epic run 130fps @1080p and ~90fps @1440p. Black Mesa ultra @1440p got 100-200fps. Single Con: Could be better priced around 130 though. I decided to have this configuration to have the possibilty to upgrade to 13600k sometime later if needed for Graphics render software.
Upgrade from i5-7400 to this. It's night and day.
"I just assembled a new computer using this processor on a Gigabyte B760 with DDR5 memory. The system came up without a hitch and the BIOS screen appeared very professional. I installed Ubuntu 22.04, the only thing I noticed was a hang when installing 22.04.1, so I had to initially select safe mode. I recommend using 22.04.3 (current) because it probably fixes that issue.With 20 cores total this processor is just a downgraded i5-13600k, I don't overclock anyways so it fits my needs. RAM and the sleep function work perfectly (I had trouble with the competitor's)"
"So I was stuck on Windows 10 with my LGA 1151 core i7-6700.  This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.  I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back.  My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization.  At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%.  All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11.  Will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good GPU."
"little expensive on amazon, i would buy it from newegg if you dont need the next day delivery. but the cpu works fine and was handled with care"
By default it may not boost to its marketing frequency. I had to increase power limit in motherboard settings.
"I upgraded from an i7-7700k to this and its amazing, perfect for gaming and stays cool. I have no issues or complaints what so ever."
I was having issues with a new build where I wasn't able to adjust any of my fan speeds. The included fan was not spinning faster than about 600 RPM and luckily the processor throttled itself at 100C to prevent death. After taking the fan off and powering it separately it spun up to 3000RPM. I noticed that the wires were pinched along the heatsink because the housing was screwed down too tight. It happens. After fixing it and screwing it back on (not as tight) everything seems to be working. If the CPU wasn't throttling it would have died because of a tiny mistake in the fan wiring go figure.
Excelente producto
All I can say is that I'm very happy with my purchase!
"This thing performs neck-and-neck with an i7-12700K at half the power draw, with half the heat. It has become my new go-to for sub-$1000 client gaming system builds. Pairs great with any GPU up to an RTX 4070 or an RX 7800-XT"
"Couldn't recommend more for gaming, plenty of head room on the titles I enjoy. 10 cores in total being plenty for most games, with applications running in the background like streaming and playing music."
My son needed this to build his PC gaming system. Perfect.

One of the fan piece broke off and their was no cover for the thermal paste
"Exactly what I'd expect from an Intel processor.The price point to performance ratio is good.This isn't overclockable and doesn't suffer from heavy heat ranges allowing the provided fan to act as an adequate option for CPU cooling.I wasn't expecting this to come with a cooler and didn't intend on using it when I found out it did come with one.However when I found out my AIO was just a little too big for my build this cooler came in clutch! It's nothing pretty but it does the job. It come with the standard pre-applied thermal paste that you would expect, making installation very easy. The fasteners are push-plug style, no screwing required.I ran this with just that cooler for 8+ hours in a stagnant air case under moderate loads and the temperature stayed at a safe level."
"This cpu is in the perfect spot. Itâs not like the 13400f that doesnât include an iGPU, but itâs not as high end as the 13600k, itâs perfectly in the middle of the two.My advice is if this cpu drops in price where itâs valuable enough, go ahead and pick it up. But if itâs almost the same price as the 13600k, then please go with that one."

"Got this for a homemade nas / file server, motherboard manufacturers will make this chips run at limit spec, when all you may want is completely opposite, running low power to save a bit on the electricity bill.Get it on a sale is worth it, more than 150 is not."
"Does everything I need it to do and then some, all while drawing less than 100 watts."
Im suuuuuper new to building pc's so it was my first time ever doing this.Very easy to figure how it goes into the motherboard with these little arrows on the corner. And also it is realllyy powerful for what it is it can handle all the way up to the 4070 ti which is verrry good
This is part of a system rebuild I did. It makes a very noticeable improvement in speed and capacity.
I like it
No issues with the speed but the stock cooler is no good in some more new games but other than that an exelent processor for mid range pc.
"I was extremely excited to install this i5-13500 CPU in Asrock Z790 Taichi motherboard. I did notice an improvement over 13400, but unfortunately games started to stutter. I don't know what is the reason. All of my drivers are updated. Graphics card is RTX 4080. I went back to 13400 and everything runs great. I cannot recommend 13500 for a gaming setup, but it really shines with web browsing and productivity."
"This really handles gaming well, look up bottle neck calculator onlineâ¦. Match it with some GPUs you may be quite surprised of what it is capable of. Works great with my rtx3080. Yea I like it. :)"
I bought it for its ability to transcode video files and it is working great.
For the price this is an amazing mid to high range cpu. Iâve had this for a few weeks now and it works great.
Pretty fast for gaming and day to day tasks. It gets very hot so you need decent cooling
This is the ideal choice for tight quarter ITX builds. It is easily cooled. Iâm running it in the Fractal Ridge.
It shipped timely. Works as it should
"A lot of people will say that i3s are not enough in 2024 and can't run anything. Couldn't be further from the truth. This cpu is good enough more than 90-95% of people. If you know this cpu isn't powerful enough for your work, then you are in that 5%.For gaming and for basic office/school work, this cpu is unmatched when it comes to price vs performance. The cooler it comes with had an interesting mounting mechanism but it keeps my CPU nice and cool. I've been playing Hogwart's Legacy and Baldur's Gate 3 at 1080p on ultra settings with my Arc A580.Also I managed to snag this at $95 brand new, so basically I was forced to buy it at that point or facepalm myself."
Toms Hardware recommended this processor so I gave it a shot. Have not been disappointed.
"The processor can in fine. I thought I was being smart by buying the newest 14th gen. My motherboard cannot use it, it can only use 12th and 13th gen. So I orederd the proper processor and everything is lovely now. Out smarted myself big dummie."
My son recently upgraded his computer and we bought this for him. He says it works great and hes happy with it. Good value for what we got.
"A friend told me he was running Tekken 8 on a 12th gen i3, so that was enough for me to switch my plans over to Intel.This 14th gen is incrementally faster than the previous generations but cost about the same.So far no problems, seems like a good chip."
Worked perfectly for fortnite and comes with a fan
Fast and runs cool. Very good graphics for CPU. Can game as long as you pair it with discrete GPU.
"Upgrading from i5 6600. My new i3 is so cute im going to nickname it AWESOME! The cooler is very elegant. I hope it works! Thanks! Amazon for fast shipping arriving a day early and packaged nice!I was really excited about the cooler but the mounting mechanism is aweful. It dont clip dont nice now matter how hard i tried. Theres always one last clip just loose. I can reach on the backside and pop it off easily with my finger. I can understand people on a budget and needs to rely on this cooler and intel provides, Thanks! but i switched over to a cheap waterblock and i felt way more at ease.Intel skimped on the thermal paste. upon first installation i tried a game and it throttled my cpu with turbo boost on. I took the cooler off to try another cooler and looked at the paste it barely cover the cpu.I added more paste on top of intel paste and got a 15c drop and no more throttle. If you dont have better cooling solution i advise you get more thermal paste for sure.I test CPU on game COD MW3 before with intel 6600 i get 35-50fps with a lot of micro stutter.now with new intel i3 its getting 80-120fps smooth. and the fps counter saying its only using about 10-15 % cpu activity! im very happy. Thanks!"
The processor was very power efficient i develop android apps and web development and for this the processor was beast and I do some little gaming with rx580 which combination was superb  with 5400mhz ddr5 memory 1 tb ssd . . .
"This processor is great mid to high range budget builds, if your looking for a cpu for around 10K INR, this is the perfect choice, it has 6 Cores and 12 Threads which is quite powerful. For me, pairing it with RX 6600 gave me around 120 FPS in almost all games while playing on High Graphics. About the stock cooler, the stock cooler can definitely keep the heat away, i experienced less than 60Â° while gaming, although u can go for a better cooler if u prefer that, but the stock cooler will do its job.Overall 9.5/10 product."
best budget range and entry level processor out there.. got in good condition and works great
"This will not work without graphic card, So be careful before ordering."
Thanku Appario you send me best cpu
Budget cpu for gamers and creators
"I recently purchased an i5 processor from Amazon, and unfortunately, it turned out to be defective. Despite my efforts to seek assistance from Amazon, their customer support proved unhelpful, leaving me frustrated with my hard-earned money seemingly down the drain. Disappointed with both the product and the lack of support, I advise potential buyers to exercise caution when considering this purchase."
"I upgrade from 9400f. The performance gain is a huge. I use cooler master hyper 212 with this and my cbinet have 3 intake 2 exhaust fan, Temp never cross 60Â°c even when full load stress test. The efficiency of this processor is incredible runs below 1.2 volt. It never reach 1.2v even when doing Multi core stress test.If you're building mid range PC for gaming purpose this is the cpu you should consider. At this price point there's nothing that can beat this processor."
It doesn't have integrated graphics
Try to get it under 10k and check the rankings in details sections before buying anything

This is excellent budget gaming processor... Value for moneyThe stock cooler is waste.. Better get one external cooler from coolermaster or corsair or deepcool
Good  not open box
Excellent for beginners and students
"Donât buy, thereâre selling used and defective product."
Must buy for gamers
been using it since an year no problem at all can run any current AAA game can handle multi tasking mid to not very high level gaming with no problems if u have other good combination of components integrated
Caution : Price 18k is Overprice now. Please buy it under 15k only otherwise check some other applications/sites for better price.
"The cpu is overall great for everything, itâll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnât. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you donât have an ac in your room, aio is the choice."
Best processor in this price range. Best performance all togethe.
"It is a good processor to build a low budget computer. In this processor, you have to install a separate graphic card. For the display, I would also say that installing a cooler or a liquid cooler is also very important because this processor heats up more."

Ich habe den Prozessor fÃ¼r ein H1 V2 von NZXT gekauft. Dieser lÃ¤uft ohne Probleme auf einem ASUS Strix B760i mit 2x DDR5 6000Mhz CL30.Sehr zu empfehlen!|
I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :)

"INTROCome Ã¨ giusto che sia, anzichÃ© comprare portatilini e preassemblati, un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo, e oltre a questo, condivide la sua esperienza nell'antica arte del PC Building anche con amici e parenti. Mio fratello aveva necessitÃ  di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perchÃ© trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualitÃ . Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque Ã¨ identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino piÃ¹ alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie piÃ¹ costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo piÃ¹ 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni piÃ¹ complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.L'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURECome dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni piÃ¹ ""professionali"". L'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, Ã¨ eccellente.Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttivitÃ  utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell'hardware sia all'altezza.Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po' serie puÃ² sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarÃ  usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perchÃ© non mi Ã¨ arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece Ã¨ decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che Ã¨ accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale Ã¨ abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perchÃ© per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente Ã¨ necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilitÃ  della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che Ã¨ una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perchÃ© ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? PerchÃ© con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lÃ¬ a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che puÃ² sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che puÃ² sfruttare l'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata Ã¨ la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 Ã¨ la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissÃ  cosa. La potenza di questa Ã¨ simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giÃ¹ di lÃ¬, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due Ã¨ la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore Ã¨ scarso ma per una CPU come questa Ã¨ sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore Ã¨ il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perchÃ©.Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 Ã¨ a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco piÃ¹ alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente piÃ¹ potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze piÃ¹ alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di piÃ¹ o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata Ã¨ di poco piÃ¹ potente, ma si tratta sempre di un'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100â¬ in piÃ¹. Evitatelo. Io l'ho comprato solo perchÃ© mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anzichÃ© il 12400. Altrimenti non l'avrei mai comprato.Il 12600 invece Ã¨ su un altro campo da gioco, ed Ã¨ a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze piÃ¹ alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150â¬ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget piÃ¹ alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU piÃ¹ potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.CONCLUSIONEChe dire, il 12400 Ã¨ una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l'altro. Ã eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto.|"
"Switched from 6th gen i5 (6600k) to 12400f, I can feel the significant improvement. Especially with daily tasks and games it works perfectly. I got ddr5 6000mhz cl30 ram as well, works without a problem. Combined with 4060 ti, consumes such little power and gets everything i need done so far.I got a noctua cooler for it though, works really quiet and cool. Perfect for the price. About 500sek cheaper than the version with integrated graphics, but there are low profile gpus in case you want it as a simple daily or office use."

Would be useful to specify which boards it will work with as plug and play no longer exist.
It great if you're trying to make a mid-range PC but you could spent a little more and get the i5-12600k or the i5-13500
Whatâs that noise? Oh itâs a broken cooler fan blade. Intel QA must have missed this oneâ¦ shame
"I love this cpu and its price tag. It can handle the newest games well and works quite well for graphic design applications. The only issue I have with this is your ram is locked to a maximum of 3200mhz. If you want to get it higher, consider a 12400KF"
"Good single thread performance with 6 cores and 12 threads. Relatively low power too @65w so suitable for silent PC, at much lower price point than T coded CPUs (35w)."
"Received this today, cpu was pre used and rattling around in the box in a sandwich bag. Thermal paste smeared around the cooler and cpu."
i used this cpu for my first ever pc build i pared it with an rtx 3050 6gb eagle edition its works together great
I really liked that they delivered it with care and it was on time. That was the most important part. so it was timely and they delivered it with less than a day. I like the quality but cant say itâs the best 7.5 / 10 I hope it came with a cooler for all this money tho cuz I aint keeping this if it didnât I legit spent 100 quid on this over that. So hopefully it did
Still waiting for my refund after a faulty mother board ruined the cpu and possibly my gpu amson customer service is terrible have absolutely no understanding of technical stuff and couldn't care less that I'm sat here with no computer unable to make aliving and won't even compensate for the rest of the damage the faulty mother board has caused to my pc quick enough to take my money but every excuse under the sun not to give it bk
"Was going for a top end 1080p build and from all the reviews Iâd read, the 12400F seemed like the best option. Easy to instal. Came with a cooling fan although I chose to use a bigger air cooler."
came in with broken fans on delivery
"I am not a gamer but like to keep reasonably up to date and this intel cpu fits the bill for me. Its fast and works well with my motherboard. Reasonably priced for what it does, the cooler provided is ok for my needs as well but can get a bit noisy when the cpu remains at high % for some time. But overall very happy with this processor."
"what a sexy chip this is easy to install lighting fast , 10 cores 16 threads. very happy. would defiantly recommend ."
"Absolutely stunning cpu for the price, if you pair it with the 3060 you can play everything"
Bang for the buck!
This CPU is well priced and very fast for the price. Very happy customer indeed. Highly recommended!
"This is my first bad experience with the i5 x400F series. Tried it on a fairly decent MSI Z790 Tomahawk motherboard.I tried the i5 8400, 10400F, 11400F and now this 13400F, and this is the first one that dissapoints.The turboboost behavior is not what I'm used to. I do not recommend this one. The performance overall is better then the older ones ofcourse, but the powerlimits and frequencies are all over the place, and not how it should be on paper. Max turbo power should be 143Watts and all core turbo 4.1GHz . My sample's All core turbo didn't go above 3.9GHz and the power draw didn't went above 80 watts. and that's lower then previous gens. Therefore it's underperforming. Weird behavior on this chip. Returned it."
"I knew there was two versions of the i5-13400f based on Alder and Raptor. But the Raptor was as rare as hens teeth in retail, supposedly kept for the OEM market and for slightly more power and without a boxed cooler. Well what did I get? The Raptor around 5% quicker than Alder, anything quicker in pc gaming is a plus. LolYou can also recognize Stepping B0 (Raptor Lake) in a better catalog by the S-Spec code, which is SRMBG. It differs from Stepping C0 (Alder Lake, S-Spec code SRMBN) in the last letter of the designation â âGâ instead of âNâ Check the CPU die as per my picture. It also shipped with the Laminar RM1 cooler on my MSI MAG Tomahawk WIFI DDR5. Happy days! Check the net for more tech by inputting the two spec codes above. Iâm playing Cyberpunk 2077 and an RTX 4060 TI at 1440P everything on ultra using Super DLSS and getting near 100FPS. Bearing in mind itâs both CPU and GPU intensive. Superb processor!"
"I was looking to upgrade my 10 year old Dell system to make it compatible with Windows.  This CPU stood out as it had a lot of cores, good speed specification and without the on board GPU it was a good price.  The supplied Intel cooling fan is very good, overall a good purchase."
Bought it as an upgrade from my last and it has been perfect so far.
"Very happy, I upgrade from an i5 9th gen 9600KF, night and day on some game !Very chill in temp with my arctis freezer II 280mm, 40-50Â° in game"
a good gaming cpu
Would recommend this cpu to anyone it is so quick doesn't break a sweat !
Itâs not a bad cpu at all for the price and works great for gaming.Yes there are better but more money
Good
10 cores for Â£200! I have this running with a 3070ti with zero processor bottle neck.Check your motherboards bios before installing though as it will need to be on the latest to run the new 13th gen processors. I found that out the hard way because I bought a new motherboard at the same time and had to borrow a 12th gen processor to be able to update the bios! All good now though running 10/10 and future proof.
"I like intel CPU's and I know this one is good value for money. However, the internal box came damaged while the main amazon box was fine, meaning Amazon packed an already damaged product"
"I ( also, I am NOT THE ONLY commenter in this case ) received only a FAN in my order, DONT BUY IT"
"much better than equivalent 12th gen, more cores , more power"
I recently upgraded from the i5-8400 and this CPU was definitely worth it. My overall performance on my rig has increased with more smoother outputs and no stuttering at all on games I play.Easy to install and 100% worth it.
"So far so good only had it installed for 3 days but working very well, and I chose not to pay the Â£10 delivery and it was still sent out with DPD"
I get what I expected !Perfect Delivery !
Works as designed.

"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen."
"Itâs very capable for modern gaming without disappearing the average user who games a lot. The stability is great. Itâs very fast, it never stutters, and doesnât disappoint. Itâs well worth the money. With a proper 360mm AIO cooler, it doesnât get too hot. I used an Asus TUF Gaming AIO cooler for gaming. Itâs pretty easy to install."
"Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.My setup -MSI MPG z790 carbon wifiIntel i9 14900kMSI RTX 4070tiMSI MAG coreliquid liquid coolerSamsung 980 Pro - 1 TBRipjaws 32gb ddr5Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you.

Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
"I just built a new gaming PC. MSI MAG Tomahawk motherboard, I9 14900k CPU, MSI Coreliquid S280 AIO, MSI 4090 Gaming X Trio, 2x WD Black SN850x SSDs, 64GB Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 RAM. It is a beast of a machine.CPU has never gone over 75c even playing games @ 4k, idle it sits around 40c. Gaming/rendering/photo and vidoe manipulation is effortless and super fast."
Core i7 14700kI was afraid the item to be made in Israel which willl leave me to returnBut my core came made in US and assembled in VeitnamRecommend to buy from the same seller
Not buying a cpu from this seller again wen my order came I opened the box and the cpu was not in the box even tho it still has the factory seal wast of almost 1k bucks
Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
Instead of buying i9 buy this and you will get 20 cores and safe alot of money
"Arrived earlier than expected, a very good Cpu. Expansive but what could we do."
"Perfect CPU, fast and reliable.Fast delivery"
"I will test later.Send me invoice, please."
Does itâs job
"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."
"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"
"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."
I had to return it back the moment I saw on the box manufactured in IsrÃ¦lâ¦getting AMD instead
"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."
I dont know how to think about this information
"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."
"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."
"Lot of power, enough for any game, especially if you add APO from intel but you need a good cooler because these run hot !Ps: also deactivate in your BIOS the auto tunning if you have an high end motherboardâ¦ these are pumping insane volts and watts in the cpu"
"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."
"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."
"Don't let the naysayers talk you down from this CPU. It has everything you'd want at an amazing value to performance ratio - pair it with any GPU released in the last 6 years and you'll be able to run just about anything at mid-high settings in 1080p-1440p. If you can get on sale too, so much the better.Runs stable and cool even when over locked - just be aware that there's no integrated graphics on this, so you need a dedicated GPU to post if you're building a new rig."
It is an Intel... should always be 4-5 stars
if you have a 13th gen dont upgrade.
When compare to amd ryzen 7 7000 processors i5 14600k will easily beat in all aspects. But this will consume a lot of power and generate more heat. So we have to take atleast 700W with 80+ certified psu and a good liquid cooler. Any how As usually we can enjoy with this beast.
The seller posted the item but there was a delay from the postal service so they got the item back and posted the item with express delivery instead. Excellent and professional seller!
Installation was great! It was my first time building a PC and nothing went wrong!
"Works just fine.  Looking back you can get pretty similar performance on a 13th gen and save like $30, or go up to the I7 which gives you two more performance cores.  It is working great though and cooler than the 14 gen I7 and I9."
"I got this CPU because I've been a long term Intel user and I have never had problems with them. This one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work (mostly Office, Internet content) and gaming (COD MW3). In terms of power consumption and heat generation, I can hardly notice it since all the workload I put on it hardly heats it up more than 45C-50C. I'm not a video/photo content creator nor a streamer, so this works for me. For example, while playing COD MW3 and Ultra settings the CPU use is about 2% while my GPU, RTX 3080, carries 98% of the bottleneck workload."
Paired with a discounted Z690 board for gaming. New build posted and I updated the bios for this chip. No issues. Will update for experience of how it does with my 4070Ti Super.
Paired with a 360 MSI AIO this 14700K never gets out of the 50âsC area. Most everyone(AMD fanboys) wants you to believe these run very hot and they donât. Get a good cooler and youâll be fine. Runs any game I throw at it just paired with a 4090.
"I bought this cpu to upgrade form the fx8350 I was running and I have to say paired with a rtx 2060 supper runs smooth at 4k 60fps with no problems what so ever, I would definitely recommend this cpu to anyone needing a upgrade form later gen cpus."
"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!"
"Basic processor used from my home PC, does exactly what was requested and ordered"
Big upgrade from my 9 years old 5820K.
"For my needs, itâs the perfect âbang for the buckâ balance between performance and price."
"So, being an AMD fanboy, I was not keen on getting this, but the c/t (cores to threads) kinda caught my eye. Running 12 cores, and 20 threads (4 e-cores i think) I thought, well, for the price, it should be okay?I was wrong...This cpu is a monster in my eyes. Running with 32GB of ram (ddr4) and matched with the RTX 4070 GPU being cooled by the Artic Liquid Freezer ii, there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max. I would recommend this piece of kit to anyone, starting out or continuing on with building computers for their ""high end"" gaming etc. I have not once seen this struggle."
This cpu is very powerful and can run games (when paired with a good graphics card) up to 300+ FPS without any problems or stutters. Make sure that you keep it cooled with a good cooler as well. It is also a great price for the product you are getting.
Excellent cpu and great value
"If you're not going next gen, this is your best option, great price and amazing performance both in gaming and productivity"
"Great CPU, put it in a new personal gaming rig and it hits 5.3ghz out of the box no tweaking and runs stable as can be. Very happy."
Good.......
"Big improvement going from 4 cores to 20 cores. Too bad about the price, though. It's unlocked and I've got it running at plus 41 percent. I guess I just verbally kissed my warranty goodbye."
Intel CPU is good
super
Fast and nice. Good shopping experience for me.
"The Intel Core i7-12700K has significantly enhanced my gaming and productivity experience. This processor combines raw power with excellent integrated graphics, making it an ideal choice for both gamers and professionals."
"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that. AMD seems to be all the hype but I see why Intel won't be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip."
"the one i bought one year ago had instability. didn't know it was the CPU until it really started acting up. had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the CPU. When i reached out to Intel, they Informed me about a policy about ''tray'' processor and ''boxed'' processor. basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they don't cover warranty. As for Boxed processor, they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more. Fortunatly, the one i got was a boxed one, but still Intel told me i had a ''tray'' processor. i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a ''box'' processor. It was a bit unnerving, but at the en, they offered me the warranty and i'm supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them."
Got it as an upgrade over my old 8700k and this is a huge upgrade. I do recommend installing a contact frame such as the thermalright for this CPU
got it the next day as stated and was exactly as advertised. Yes would buy from again
"Just be sure to match up the chip correctly on the socket (one corner has a triangle cutout)Easy to install.Runs smooth and is not a power hog or a supernova in terms of heat.Even at load, it performs well.Perfect for gaming, no issues in keeping up with GPU."
Good enough for this price range
"I like the integrated graphics as I'm not using it for high-end gaming. I was disappointment to find it didn't come with a cooler. I've been spoiled by AMD. Also it was difficult to fit it into the socket to the point that I was worried about damaging it. Things worked out in the end and I have no complaints about its operation now. Three months in, no problems."
"runs Microsoft Flight simulator on multiple 32"" screens beautifully."
I heard good things about this cpu and went for it. Budget friendly and a very good cpu!
Great product/Brand Intel i7 CPU. I have been using the Intel brand CPU's and have been using the i7 and the K series since they were introduced. This seems to handle video processing and CAD/CAM projects quite well. I have always had great luck with Intel brand processors and will continue using them. Pretty good value for the cost.
"Compared to the Coffee Lake generation I had been (willingly) stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap. Before buying I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a fan of Intel's newer way of handling cores, but the first thing I tried when I got it was emulating PS3 games and right off the bat I saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled.The older CPUs from the 8th, 9th, and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if you're on a budget maybe look on the used market for those. But if you really need something powerful this is a good option."
"I upgraded from the i7 6700k to the i3 13100 and saw a great performance increase. I was eager to test ddr5. However,  I also wanted to experiment with 6+ core processors. Fortunately I found this i7 12700k when the price dropped to 275. I wasn't sure if it would be a big increase from the i3 and the i7 6700k. But the i7 12700k is a ferocious beast that has crushed all tasks I've given it and brought immesnse life back to my RTX 2060 super and it stays cools & fluent.Z790 auros elite axI7 12700k overclocked pcores 5.2 ghz ecores 4.0 ghz 50-65Â°C during multi intensive tasks and games for long periods of timeRTX 2060 super 8bg ddr6Corsair vengeance 6000mhz ddr5Cyberpunk 60-65 fps 1080 ultra+psycho with medium ray tracing with a low of 59Starfield 30- 40 1080p fps high settings the devs need to optimize thoughHorizon zero Dawn 80-85 fps 1080 ultraShreds through video editing and music editing all at onceAmazing at multitaskingPowerfulFastCan be placed in ddr4 mobos and ddr5 mobos"
Exactly what I needed
Perfect
"This item has been with me for a very short time.So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.I hope you find this review helpful."
"The morning after building and setting up windows, drivers, etc. The PC had blue screened because of temperatures, and after a reset and entering the BIOS I saw that the temperature was 89 degrees celsius. Thankfully, after some trial and error I was able to undervolt it and not have my CPU die. I'd suggest anyone who looks into getting an intel CPU to undervolt it!"
Huge upgrade from 8th gen i5! paired it with the ASRock Z690 and 32g DDR4
"At this time in the product life cycle, the 12th gen CPU is about half the cost of the 14th gen CPU.  It is more than fast enough for everything I do.  My major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have TPM 2.0.  The CPU was easy to install, it is running between 36-37 degrees Celsius (though I admit I am not stressing it).  I am very happy with my purchase."
"A great performance, cheap enough for the performance it gives. I got this for 210$ on BF. Recommend!"
"This is a very good product, and there are no issues with its features and performance. The usage process is also very smooth, and there hasn't been any overheating so far."
This appears to be the best option for intel at this price range. Works as advertised.
It's a top-of-the-line CPU that will last for a long time. There's nothing to dislike about it.it replaced a 12 year 3770K!
"æç¹å¹æè³¼è²·çï¼ä½¿ç¨ä¸æ²æä»»ä½çåé¡ï¼ç©è¶æå¼ãI purchased it at a special price, and I haven't encountered any issues in terms of usage. It offers great value for the money."
If you're looking for an Intel cpu I would recommend this even though it is a couple years old now I belive its still the best intel cpu for gaming
"Went from a 9400f to this was a big different on gaming, i finally get the fully potencial of my gpu"
Excelente
"Wow what an incredible black Friday deal. Seriously, $211 is well worth it for the performance. I also purchased the 12600k for $153 which is another unbeatable deal offered this year at amazon. If you managed to get your hands on either one of you made the right choice."
"Great cpu, would buy again."
"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable."
This is a second purchase of core i7 12700. It works very well as expected.
"for my limited budget, I bought it, While the 12700K isn't the top of the line, at least for me, it was more affordable and very performant. I've had good success overclocking it and actually undervolting  it to reduce temperatures!"
"So far so good, but then that's what I said about the last one...  I'll check back in a year on this and hope it outlasts my prior CPU.As for the last one... it's Intel dropping the ball with their QC it seems.  Had an IMC function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed.  Couldn't run any XMP profiles, and swapping the processor solved it (not a Mobo issue).Just watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen, and return it if *anything* seems even *remotely* off."
"Great CPU for multitasking, I don't know too much about CPU but this is great!"
"I've installed a 10th gen 2x, 12th gen, and a 13th gen on my family's pc's. I've never had a problem."
"The heart of my PC build and wanted to have the ""K"" version with the Integrated Graphics... even though I was going to have a GPU anyways, it's a good backup if the GPU fails.Can't do a Pro and Con here as there is nothing much to report.It plays every game without bottlenecking my RTX 3070 and was a breeze to install (there is literally one way to install it. <You'd have to intentionally or forcibly install it wrong).Also, it runs surprisingly cool and doesn't act like an easy-bake oven in my Motherboard."
"Not much to say about this cpu. It's Intel, and these are immortal. Still have the 3770K I got like 10 years ago, and an Extreme I got even earlier than that.So the main motive here is to let Amazon know that I HAVE received the item, but I don't know how to let them know so they can change the ""package left at mail"" to ""Already received""..."
"I got the CPU on sale and I would say the performance is great, my application is running smoothly and does not come into any problem for a year now."
"Bought this K to have graphics backup. The CPU is great the graphics not so much. Still I do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my PC, but only for the purpose of having temporary backup when needed. So for that purpose it works. The cost vs the KF is fairly negligible so for its primary purpose it is a very good CPU."
"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:1. i9-13900k2. i7-13700k3. i9-12900k4. i5-13600k5. i7-12700kThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)"
"this thing is a workhorse! ive got mine clocked to 5.0GHz and it runs like a dream, keep in mind this unit will require a water pump air coolers are not enough!"
"Bought this for a new personal PC. My last was an i7 4790K build that got totaled out (crushed) during shipping. After building a new one on a z790i platform, the performance gain was stunning, completely night and day! I cannot say enough about this CPU, and would totally recommend this product!!"
"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.Good luck!"
"I had been planning to hold off for Raptor Lake, but my Z370 mobo died, and I decided to go ahead and get an Alder Lake i7.  So far it's impressive.  It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months.  3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be,  from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect.  The days of getting another 800Mhz - 1 Ghz+  over stock clocks out of a CPU are gone it seems."

This is my best buy so far for gaming and editing. It runs great whatever you throw. Excellent performance so far. Cinebench score is 29000 at 125 TDP.Suggestion: Buy only if you have very good amount of cooler.
good
"I bought this to replace my 10850k after I realized how much it was holding back my 4090.  I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.  I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads."
"Upgraded to the 13700k from the 11900k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive. This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these high-end CPU's more or less all perform equal (or would if they all worked properly), but it's easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30-day window for return to Amazon is closed."
I upgraded to this 13700k from an 8700k.Huge improvement in speed and general PC performance and whilst running msfs and general gaming.I water cool so temperature not much over 60'c.
"Playing valorant with competitive settings, average 99% fps is 400+"

Your results may vary depending on your specific hardware and software configuration"
"This processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old i7-6700K. According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in âecoâ mode in my motherboardâs settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you donât need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium. If you also donât plan to overclock, consider the i7-13700F."
Might be overkill for most builds since i5 13600k is a very good choice as well.
Has really improved my gaming and streaming services along faster and better than my 7th gen i7
"|The media could not be loaded.|In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case â compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included â actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180Â°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a) Â MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF, Â https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTXâ¢ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 HaloÂ² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion)."
"Wow welcome to a real gaming cpu. This runs good, have not OC, stays cool with my 360aio. No stability issues, nothing but a great freakn experience. Very happy with this purchase."
"Great Cpu, worked great out of the box and runs like a dream"
"This is my first upgrade since the i7-4790k, this processor is a BEAST! Eats away at any task i throw at it without a sweat! I was a little hesitant with the new cpu designs with the Performance and efficiency cores but man, the efficiency cores alone kill my 4790k! ðð» great cpu, just make sure you know these shoot to the sky heat wise when you punch heavy workloads and you will need cooling to match depending of how long and how much you will need to pull away from it. ðð»"
"Purchased on sale for $334. The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt. Intel is still my preference for CPUs and I don't foresee that changing, especially with all of the issues I've read regarding AMD chips (boot up issues, crashes, poor multi-core performance)."
"My previous build had an i7-9700K and after 5 years of abuse, I decided to upgrade in this new build to an i7-13700K and I'm not disappointed.  It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it.  Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup.  During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues.

"No surprises here, the cpu functions exactly as advertised."
I am a team blue guy. And I think this is a great cpu for the money. Currently running at 5200 and very stable.
Really love this processor itâs really fast using the adobe apps. Recommended for content creation.
"What can you say about this processor that hasn't already been said. Just know you need a good cooler on it, because it does get HOT! Performance is great and with Intel's XTU app it is easy to overclock and achieve even more."
"Overlocking the crap out of this with liquid cooling. Rock solid - not a blue screen in site. Dedicate 8 cores to a VM with no appreciable decline in bare metal OS operation. Temps are higher with the same cooler as compared to 12700k (12700k running 30-40C under load, this jumps to the 50-60C area pretty quick."
Excelente
Put this in a gaming machine and it seems to be handling everything really well so far. The price point was right
Item as described and works perfectly!
Good deal and for the delivery
"The highest package temps my CPU gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees Celsius. And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how. Long story short if you want max performance to play around with just get a i9 processor, that's what those are made for, for everyone else there's this one!"
"I use this i7-13700K every day for about a year. I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use. Is it all of this the fastest? I have no idea. Does it boot and work reliably everytime so far? Absolutely!"
A very good midrange processor. I've use one for years and it has always worked well for me.

I got this CPU to upgrade from my 11th gen i7-11700KF Processor. Temps are a slight bit toasty compared to my 11th gen CPU but pairs real well with my 4070 ti.
"|The media could not be loaded.|Replacement from the core i5-12700kf; booted right away, all cores shown & while undercooked works perfectly! Baby in the background couldn't believe it. Thank you Amazon for coming through once again with a formidable solution. Paid the extra $100 to make sure the problem of the i5 did not continue to occur. Problem solved!"
"Nice!  I upgraded from an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X to this CPU (and the components below) and I couldn't be happier.  Everything opens almost instantly, whether it be Windows 11's File Explorer, Edge browser and webpages, and opening files in general.  I upgraded primarily because I am a developer, and Visual Studio + Dotfuscator would take almost 8 minutes to compile and obfuscate my largest program on my old build.  After upgrading, it now compiles in about 4 mins 45 seconds.  The longest part is Dotfuscator, not Visual Studio compiling.  Compiling happens in seconds on this setup.My components:|MSI MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi Gaming Motherboard||Intel Core i7-13700K Desktop Processor|(this CPU)|CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 5600MHz||MSI MPG A1000G PCIE 5 & ATX 3.0 Gaming Power Supply - Full Modular - 80 Plus Gold Certified 1000W||Corsair MP700 2TB PCIe Gen5 x4 NVMe 2.0 M.2 SSD||Cooler Master Hyper 212 Halo White CPU Air Cooler||MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Graphics Card|I don't game much, but there is a noticeable difference loading and playing Cities: Skylines after upgrading, too.I am very happy with the new PC.  Everything runs smoothly, I haven't had a single crash running the XMP Profile in BIOS for my RAM so it runs at full speeds.  This CPU blows the Ryzen 7 5800X out of the water.  Check out the UserBenchmark: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X vs Intel Core i7-13700K comparison on UserBenchmark's website for details, which is what I did before purchase.  It lives up to the benchmarks for me."
"After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year.  I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again."
Iâm very happy with this processor.
Just what I needed.  It is fast and it's not annoying. Used it for a small rig.
"I had a Ryzen 7 3800xt cpu for a while now so I went for a new upgrade and went for Intel for this generation. This processor works faster and better compared to what I had previously. This cpu is basicaly like an efficient i9 12900k, so if your looking for a high end processor just get this 13th gen. Also at this time the 14th gen i7 just got released but based on the reviews its more like a 13th gen Intel ks proccesor. That why I never went that route."
"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade. I don't claim to be Steve from Gamers Nexus, or a pro CPU tester - but I can tell you that this thing is amazing, and will serve you well for years to come."
"I was close to give them a bad review but then I found out USPS was the problem with my delivery.  If possible, find another shipping method to avoid delays.  Product exactly as described, much needed! Now I can finish building my pc. Thank you"
Spend the money once and get a good processor you wont regret!
without a doubt good CPU stays cool over clocked at 35 c runs good worth the money.
"Paired with my 3060ti founders edition, I have yet to run a game that seems like this combo couldnât handle. Apart from gaming it can handle multiple instances of tasks and run them all seamlessly. This is the most powerful CPU Iâve had but it still impresses me how fast everything is and I have not seen its limits yet."
"The i7-13700K has i7-12900K performance at an i7 range price range. Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboardâs vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMDâs expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intelâs 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me). I also like to note the CPU fits only fits one way and the CPU lever has a bit of tension, so donât be afraid when installing your CPU."
"I had a 6 year old Acer TC-780 desk top with an i7-7700 cpu. Due to not able to upgrade to windows 11 and microsoft scheduled to stop supporting windows 10 October 2024.  I gave myself a year to shop for a new PC Knowing Black Friday/Cyber Monday have the best prices and deals.  I like the Gaming RGB astatic and after months of researching online I decided I was going to Build my next PC.  Black Friday came early this year Thanks to Prime Day, and  MSI Mag Z790 Tomahawk MB,  and V- color DDR5 Oc 7200mhz 32g RAM, and MSI RTX4070 GPU And the Intel i7-13700K  all powered from a Gamemax 1050W PSU,  I have a Brand new POWERFUL Gaming PC That will serve me well in the years to come."
"I got this for a new system build even though a little higher than I like to spend. But it has performed great.After, I noticed a drop in performance and doing research, I found out that these run very very hot and the thermal protection had kicked in to throttle the processor down. I tried a few Air cooled options that did the trick, but they were too loud for me, so I ended up with a Liquid cooled option which is what I would recommend to anyone using this processor. Currently, my idle temps are around 41c and at 100% utilization, temps average around 60-70 with a quick peak of 95. I dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons, but I did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what I did. 13th Gen blows away 12th gen. This I7 even bests the i9 12th gen. Great chip as long as you keep it cool."
Iâm sure the chip works beautifully but I had no idea the k series didnât come with a cooler which is very upsetting for the price point. I now realize very small at the bottom of description it says no thermal cooling. Wish it said that in the main details.
"I love this chip, fast and efficient also stays cool with my 280MM AIO.  I had to replace my MB and Intel i7 8th gen 8700K so got this over the i9 and could not be happier.  Wish Intel would drop their prices but it is a value for what you get"
"fast cpu, did not come with a cpu cooler. Make sure you get agood cpu cooler if you play games!!! This cpu runs very HOTif you max it out. Recommend water cooler or LARGE air cooled."
"The i7 runs a bit hotter than the 13th gen i5, but I just couldn't resist spending a bit more for those extra cores. As of 2023, it's a razor-fast CPU for the average buyer - probably too powerful for anyone but power-users and video-editors. As for gaming, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problems, too.It CAN run with a low-power or stock-quality cooler for daily tasks, but I'd recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavy-duty loads at it, or good-performance air cooling if you're planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future."
"Nothing to say, all is okay"
"Running in XMP mode, all cores synced, with ram clocked at 7200mhz! No problems whatsoever. Runs fast and cool compared to my old 5930k."
I wanted speed without breaking the bank and this CPU fits the bill. Runs a little hot but not too much to handle with an AIO water cooler (I use a Deepcool LT520). Pleased with my build.
its great. just buy it. or the 14700k.
Great value for my gaming PC :D
"If you are looking to get the best gaming experience with the decent price and not getting poor processing power, this is your option, you get the flagship power with lower price than competitor.It is usually huge amount of power however in load, but for person like me keeping OC most of the time, this is where E cores getting into the play.I'm not Intel fan anymore, I wanted to get AMD but because AMD requires DDR5 and much expensive for no payback compared to Intel, I did choose this, and I'm not regretting it.So TL;DR: if you are short in budget, and want something last long for next years, get this one fore sure."
"Absolutely great CPU, fast, efficient, and perfect for gaming. Itâs the ideal CPU for gamers, especially coming from a 9700k. I noticed drastic improvements in my gaming and I highly recommend for others. Great buy."
"I replaced a 7th generation I7 CPU with this one.  The difference in performance is dramatic (although I the also replaced the MOBO, which contributed to the improvement).  I may have bought too much CPU power.  The ASUS diagnostics that I run show that the CPU rarely runs at more than 10% of capacity (although I also installed a new GPU so most of the graphics processing is offloaded).Installation in the ASUS motherboard was straightforward, although the socket size has changed from my previous Intel CPU, and I had to purchase a new mounting bracket for my cooler, which I did not replace."
Open box/used good condition item. Purchased for my Wife's latest build... Wound up having a better memory controller than my old 13900KS ... runs reeeeally cool.
"Above are screenshots of my Passmark benchmark, both systems exactly the same, except the first picture has the 13700K and the second picture has the 12700K in it. The rest of the components are HX1200, Asus ROG Maximus Hero Z690, Gskill Trident DDR5 F5 6000Mhz, Adata Legend 840 SSD  X2 set up in RAID 0. Vetroo Lurker 240mm AIO water cooling, Power color RX 6900 XT. I run all (P) cores synced at 5300 MHz. Temps idle at about 32 to 35C, hard benchmarking takes it up as high as 88 C once, typically about 75C. Ordinary gaming, tasking takes it to about 45 to 50C.If you are wondering if its worth the upgrade, it is. But considering that my system is one of the fastest in the world with these components, I would have to say that upgrading to a Z790 motherboard is NOT worth it if you already have a Z690.That is all, and good day to you."
"Very impressive CPU almost on par with the i-9 just slightly fewer e-cores which if your not an editor or creator of some sort you really won't miss them. Gaming wise this CPU has hit all my benchmarks, with a solid score on cinebench time after time. Runs a little hot while gaming among other things roughly around 65 to 72Â°C at highest times, but with the right cooler you will be impressed! Does not come with stock cooler! Would recommend"
"Upgraded from Asus Prime Z390-A (i7 9700k) to Asus ROG Strix Z790-1 Wifi D4 (i7 13700k). Using Noctua NH-U12A air cooler. Temperatures around 60 C when gaming, with spikes around 75 C. Most users report this processor tends to run hot. I have not stress tested but have heard reports of throttling when under extreme (not typical user) load. Overall happy with the choice."
"Itâs insane, the speed you get for its price is absolutely great. Itâs granted me a 40+ fps increase on Baldurâs Gate and has helped me in development and lighting in 3D applications. It been stable at 5.4 ghz and is amazing for games. The die is larger than the older CPUs due to its newer lga1700 chipset, so I recommend getting the ThermalRight contact frame (also have a review for it). OVERALL worth it, better if you get it on discount."
Super fast and stable CPU. Note that it can run hot because of the higher voltage it can use. I made sure to get a nice AIO for it. Coupled with an arctic freeze II 306 it rarely gets above 30C.
Product is great. Delivery was a let down.
So I am building my new system starting with I7-13700k upgrading from my pre built Alienware I7-9700k it came out incredible and fast. Love Intel.
good intel cpu but overpriced. good graphics with intel 770 uhd.
"Nice processor works great, stays cool."
"It is what it is, an action packed CPU"
"If youâre looking at this as a gaming-only processor, youâll probably get 95% of the gaming performance this offers with the cheaper and cooler i5-13600k. Save your money and put it into a better GPU over buying this because that will actually result in more FPS where this processor (over the 13600k) will not.That being said, this processor is a monster. Itâs a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up. Most stable and speedy system Iâve ever owned. 13th gen might have come out before Ryzen 7000 series, but I still think itâs the winner.EKâs Nucleus 360mm AIO did a great job at keeping this CPU under control."
"This was the first Generation 13 processor we used in a build. Of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that. Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation.  The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2Â°-3Â° C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions. All in all, obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can't see justification for anyone taking their i9-12900k out and installing i9-13900k. The gains would probably not be really experienced."
"Amazing CPU, noticed huge improvements in performance almost everywhere (faster load times, higher FPS in games, etc.) Performance was especially noticeable in CPU heavy games such as WoW, that don't require as much GPU power and are heavily bottlenecked by CPU. In cases like those I doubled FPS going from 9th gen to 13th gen Intel.One thing to note: 13th gen Intel is HOT! You may be coming from an older CPU and used to 60-70 C temperatures at max, then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot. That's just how it is. If you're worried about longevity, set an undervolt offset of about -0.10 (preferably in your motherboard's BIOS settings) and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability."
There is a very slight non noticeable difference between it and the i9-14900k which makes this one very good deal in terms of valueWorks great and no complaints
Works great.
The build is: Intel Core i7 13700K+ MSI MAG Z790 TOMAHAWK WIFI Motherboard DDR5 + MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ti VENTUS 3X 8G OC + 2x CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6400MHz CL32 + Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux CPU Liquid Cooler = Just a Perfect build!
"Motherboard (Gigabyte z790 ud ac) not detecting cpuThe packaging was worst..Go to store instead, test it and buy it.Don't buy!"
I don't liked the price of it .I Also don't liked the performance of it .Rather you can purchase i9 13th generation
13 gen is better with same performence at low pricing. Avoid this product cause it have only 2 core touching 6000 mhz so in real life there are no difference.
What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money
Beast gaming world 2nd most powerful processor my set up has this processer and RTX 4070 16gb ram 2048gb(2tb) nvme m.2 ssd 850 watts pls buy it
"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen."
"Itâs very capable for modern gaming without disappearing the average user who games a lot. The stability is great. Itâs very fast, it never stutters, and doesnât disappoint. Itâs well worth the money. With a proper 360mm AIO cooler, it doesnât get too hot. I used an Asus TUF Gaming AIO cooler for gaming. Itâs pretty easy to install."
Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
"I just built a new gaming PC. MSI MAG Tomahawk motherboard, I9 14900k CPU, MSI Coreliquid S280 AIO, MSI 4090 Gaming X Trio, 2x WD Black SN850x SSDs, 64GB Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 RAM. It is a beast of a machine.CPU has never gone over 75c even playing games @ 4k, idle it sits around 40c. Gaming/rendering/photo and vidoe manipulation is effortless and super fast."
Core i7 14700kI was afraid the item to be made in Israel which willl leave me to returnBut my core came made in US and assembled in VeitnamRecommend to buy from the same seller
Not buying a cpu from this seller again wen my order came I opened the box and the cpu was not in the box even tho it still has the factory seal wast of almost 1k bucks
Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
Instead of buying i9 buy this and you will get 20 cores and safe alot of money
"Arrived earlier than expected, a very good Cpu. Expansive but what could we do."
"I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some.  I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good.  It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.Gaming seems fine, no issues.  I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!  Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around."
"Perfect CPU, fast and reliable.Fast delivery"
"I will test later.Send me invoice, please."
Does itâs job
"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."
"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"
"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."
I had to return it back the moment I saw on the box manufactured in IsrÃ¦lâ¦getting AMD instead
"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."
I dont know how to think about this information
"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."
"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."
"Lot of power, enough for any game, especially if you add APO from intel but you need a good cooler because these run hot !Ps: also deactivate in your BIOS the auto tunning if you have an high end motherboardâ¦ these are pumping insane volts and watts in the cpu"
"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."
"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."
"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("
This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .
"This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.  I'm sure it will play all the latest games just fine. and If it doesn't I can just pop in a different proc."
"The Intel Core i9-14900K processor is a beast when it comes to gaming and multitasking. With its 24-core configuration (8 Performance-cores and 16 Efficiency-cores), this CPU handles everything from intense gaming sessions to heavy-duty content creation smoothly and without a hitch. The unlocked feature allows for overclocking, providing additional performance boosts as needed. Integrated graphics are a great addition, capable of handling basic video tasks and supporting displays without the need for a separate GPU. This processor consistently delivers high speeds and reliable performance, making it a top choice for anyone building a high-end PC. Whether you're gaming at the highest settings, streaming, or juggling multiple intensive applications, the i9-14900K stands up to the challenge."
This thing is a beast! Very powerful indeed.  Works flawlessly. I just finished building my desktop computer.  Very joyful to have and to play with.  I am very happy with the CPU.
"Overall this processor has worked well. I have had some minor issues with the PC crashing while playing games and I have not been able to pinpoint root cause. However, after doing some research, I did find that there are known issues with this processor. Had I known this prior to purchasing, I probably would have purchased a cheaper and more stable processor. Do your research prior to purchasing."
"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days."
It is very fast but it also runs very hot when running at full load. Be sure to build with a liquid cooler.
"Be careful with cooling. Try to keep under 75 celcious, so water cooling is the best option here. Great performance and stability is achieved under 75 degrees. Using it for 3d graphic rendering. 5 stars."
"In 2020 I made the mistake of switching to AMD. The system I built was so annoying. The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed. Slowed everything down and made a lot of unnecessary noise. With my new Intel-based system, those issues are gone, and I have a lightning fast PC. Learned my lesson about AMD!"
The only reason I knocked down the rating under value for the money is because I feel Intel is charging too much for this product. But hey that's just my opinion. Anyways. Good product. Puts AMD to shame is all ways again in my opinion.
"Great processor, well packaged. I like the wafer case. Very protected. Top of the line speed and quality"
Works great in new build! Only slight issue is I felt like there wasn't quite enough thermal paste... I had some leftover from a previous build so I added some additional just to be safe.
"The CPU is really strong for both gaming and video-editing/movie creation. Haven't had any issues within the past 6 months I've had this. Never gave any issues, no malfunctions and it never stutters and this is without O.C. the CPU."
I was afraid to purchase the 14th gen after all the talk of stability issues. When the the Bios fixes were mentioned I took a shot. I'm up and running with the power limits adjusted accordingly.
"Awesome CPU, and an absolute beast!I did not, however, recieve my code for Star Wars Outlaws. Amazon says it's an Intel thing, yet you cannot contact Intel to ask. Any ideas?"
"This processor has way better memory controller then my previews 12900k for my DDR4 clocking at 3950 MHz at 15-15-15-30 timing error free. I had heard about the 14900k has crashing issues so far I have no issues with Unreal Engine 5 games, Tekken 8, Battlefield 2042, etc, etc.... My cpu is running 59 GHz all P cores @ 1.35v limited power P1 and P2 @ 253 Watts, therefore, won't over heat and degrade the  silicon of my 14900k,  55Â° average temperature on gaming with a good cooler MSI MEG Core Liquid S360 - AIO at full speed push and pull fans. All my games runs extremely smooth at high frame rates with no stuttering."
"Still love Intel despite their lack of anything groundbreaking recently. CPUâs still work great for gaming, this one included. Works right out the box and went perfect with my new MSI motherboard too."
I was able to get 240fps in CS go and valorant without external GPU.I previously had 6th gen i7 and GTX980. And that couldn't pull this.Lightroom rendering is also good i am able to color correct 100 raw pics in seconds.I didn't expect this performance when i updated.
Even running at the default 6.1ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing.  Only way to stop it is to go in bios and set the core ratio to 57 max for power cores and 43 for efficency cores. Drove me nuts trying to figure out the problem for months also buy a hefty duty power supply if you're buying a 40 series rtx graphics card constant crashing of apps and games from lack of power to the graphics card from even a 1000 watt supply
"It's a processor. It's like any other processor that processes, only better.It destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in Corel Painter. It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code.Just remember to update your BIOS because it's still a relatively new processor. And stay away from Windows 11."

While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."
I'm using this as a server CPU mostly for the SR-IOV capable GPU stability has been an issue when running windows VM's on proxmox but in light of recent news about mainboard MFG's pushing the CPU too hard out of the box that may be the source of my stability issues as I mostly left the settings OOB for the CPU
"Switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super.. this is one heck of a cpu. I only put a $60 280mm aio ""I'd cooling"" and put it on smart fan. After that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99% GPU usage in every game. Jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on. Which is unheard of from everything I read. Totally glad I went with this over 7800x3d. Mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle I wanted. My newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling.. Thanks to this cpu at its core."
"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste."
"Upgrading from a 10700KF to 14700K. Lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but Iâm here to tell you itâs well worth the money! Just make sure to go to your BIOS and limit the power to 253W. The whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion. I havenât gotten heat issues while gaming.Overall I have this chip paired with a 3090, while Iâll wait for a new 50 series card.Some of the gains Iâve gotten at @1440P, 45 in ultra wide 21:9, max graphics settings:Overwatch: overall 50fps gain, consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor.Black Desert Online: overall 35-40 fps gains.These are the games I normally play a lot and itâs truly notice when upgrading to this chip. Overall the computer is a snappy and fast and havenât notice any hiccups. Really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4-5 years."
Terrific performer for my needs.  Runs fast and pretty cool
My husband built me a computer from scratch because my old one was to slow for him. The I7 was the last thing I needed. It was easy for him to install. It performs fantastic.
"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."
Perfect
This 14th generation Intel Core i7 is a powerful and fantastic processor for a desktop gaming build.The product is well packaged with some assembly instructions that are easy to follow. I heartily recommend this computer processor for DIYs and computer enthusiasts.
I upgraded from an i9 - 11900K.  Pretty good performance increase on benchmarks.  I haven't gamed on it yet (still in the process of locking down cables and loose hardware)MB GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS PRO X
"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80â° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"
"The processor is great and arrived sealed in good condition, however, the cardboard box had no protection and it could easily be damaged if it fell."
Able to compile rust code way faster now.
"Al the benchmark websites are scams, look on youtube and you'll find the amd equivalent is way better"
Works very good.
"I received the i7-14700K today, but the packaging was very bad  (only a envelop). For such an expensive and fragile produkt Amazon should have better packaging. I returned it and will buy from another seller."
For multi purpose gaming PCs intel is a solid bet. Has never caused any issues and I game on ultra settings. Does exactly what it advertised highly recommend.
Great upgrade and very useful.
Fast delivery and just works
"Works perfectly, after upgrading from 2nd I5 from 2011 I absolutely felt the difference."
Performs better than a recent build with an i9 in and a lot cheaper.
All good.
"I recommend going AMD currently, but if you are stubborn like me hereâs a few things to bear in mind.Research 14th gen Intel stability issues.  As of today an ASUS board with the very latest bios should be okay, but itâs been a big problem for many.Coming from an i7 6700 which lasted years, this generation has been a shock.  Heat is ridiculous, you need a water cooling unit, thankfully theyâre probably easier to install than the equivalent giant brick youâd need for air cooling, which will limit performance.Donât expect miracles this generation, but itâs one of the fastest processors you can buy, and donât consider an i9 unless youâve got some insane cooling."
I have use the i7 14700k on a few builds now and it is a powerful cpu so will def use more on my builds.Price needs to come down a little.
excelente
"The latest in Intel's processor line proves once again to be an absolute beast of a processor. Upgrading from the Intel i7 10700k to the 14th gen is just insanity. It offers a huge boost in performance in every day usage - including gaming, video editing, development and AI.For anyone not looking too much into the technical side of things - if you're already looking at this product, you already made up your mind - my review isn't going to change it ;-) if you're on a CPU currently 4/5 generations behind, this is the upgrade you want."
Brilliant CPU to have
ok
Got this for a Z790 platform and it runs great after a quick BIOS update. Great performance in both gaming and CAD
Pretty nice but architecture wise it's not that radically advanced from a 13 gen i7.Still I like how balanced the performance is. Multithreaded tasks work like a charm. It's actually very stable with high speed RAM modules. And for gaming everyone tells how AMD's 7950X3D is better but honestly I find absolutely zero issues to deal with. Missing out on 5% FPS speed is something I'd rather have than dealing with switching between the 3DV CCD and a 7950X's CCD messing up qith performance or the inability to overclock (plus zero issues with asus rog motherboards)
"For the effective heat transfer to be better the CPU die would have to be larger. More surface contact with pump would increase effective cooling. That is my only complaint.The concentrated heat in the processor make it hard for the cooler / pump to keep the temps down. No matter the size of the cooler the heat transfer is the bottleneck for cooling of the CPU.The processor will no matter the cooler reach 100Â°C in about 30 seconds under full load. To keep the temps down you need to throttle power limits in motherboard BIOS and lose some performance. But effectively if you do so, CPU will no longer cap at 100Â°C, but be somewhere under 80Â°C, on average 60-70Â°C.Other than that its a beast."
"If you can keep it cool, it will perform very well."
"simply... beast! It's ""killing"" every task in a micro second :)"
"This is a monster CPU, very big difference from i7 9700k. Runes games smoothly. But my 280mm AIO can't handle the heat it produces, so I had to undervolt a bit, to keep my Temps under 100Â°C. Overall great CPU."
"Great CPU for the price, will notice the difference if upgrading, good for gaming and almost anything else"
"Fortunately, cpu works fine, but it could have been different. It was packed in cardboard envelope (bulged), which was partially deformed. Cpu wasn't damaged, but the original box it came in was. This kind of item (sensitive and pricey) should be delivered in more protective and heavy duty packaging.I've heard of some clothing items, valued around 50e that come in metal-reinforced boxes. And then you have 450e cpu stuffed in cardboard envelope.... Nonsense..."
Better invest more in better GPU (I have 4070ti).
"Runs so much faster than my last i7, and stays cool when gaming."
Jump from 3 generation to 14 -from i7-3770 to i7-14700 and power consumption with standard tasks ... similar... good job intel
As it says on tin
Amazing cpu for a high end gaming unit
"Arrived quickly, works well, no problems so farUPDA few months later the CPU turned out to be defective. HWiNFO shows constant CPU Cache L2 Errors, PC started to reboot and crash every day."
"Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.My setup -MSI MPG z790 carbon wifiIntel i9 14900kMSI RTX 4070tiMSI MAG coreliquid liquid coolerSamsung 980 Pro - 1 TBRipjaws 32gb ddr5Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you. I got my wiring fixed in matter of minutes ona video call by their assistant."
"Motherboard (Gigabyte z790 ud ac) not detecting cpuThe packaging was worst..Go to store instead, test it and buy it.Don't buy!"
I don't liked the price of it .I Also don't liked the performance of it .Rather you can purchase i9 13th generation
13 gen is better with same performence at low pricing. Avoid this product cause it have only 2 core touching 6000 mhz so in real life there are no difference.
What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money
Beast gaming world 2nd most powerful processor my set up has this processer and RTX 4070 16gb ram 2048gb(2tb) nvme m.2 ssd 850 watts pls buy it
"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen."
"Itâs very capable for modern gaming without disappearing the average user who games a lot. The stability is great. Itâs very fast, it never stutters, and doesnât disappoint. Itâs well worth the money. With a proper 360mm AIO cooler, it doesnât get too hot. I used an Asus TUF Gaming AIO cooler for gaming. Itâs pretty easy to install."
Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
"I just built a new gaming PC. MSI MAG Tomahawk motherboard, I9 14900k CPU, MSI Coreliquid S280 AIO, MSI 4090 Gaming X Trio, 2x WD Black SN850x SSDs, 64GB Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 RAM. It is a beast of a machine.CPU has never gone over 75c even playing games @ 4k, idle it sits around 40c. Gaming/rendering/photo and vidoe manipulation is effortless and super fast."
Core i7 14700kI was afraid the item to be made in Israel which willl leave me to returnBut my core came made in US and assembled in VeitnamRecommend to buy from the same seller
Not buying a cpu from this seller again wen my order came I opened the box and the cpu was not in the box even tho it still has the factory seal wast of almost 1k bucks
Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
Instead of buying i9 buy this and you will get 20 cores and safe alot of money
"Arrived earlier than expected, a very good Cpu. Expansive but what could we do."
"I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some.  I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good.  It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.Gaming seems fine, no issues.  I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!  Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around."
"Perfect CPU, fast and reliable.Fast delivery"
"I will test later.Send me invoice, please."
Does itâs job
"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."
"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"
"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."
I had to return it back the moment I saw on the box manufactured in IsrÃ¦lâ¦getting AMD instead
"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."
I dont know how to think about this information
"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."
"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."
"Lot of power, enough for any game, especially if you add APO from intel but you need a good cooler because these run hot !Ps: also deactivate in your BIOS the auto tunning if you have an high end motherboardâ¦ these are pumping insane volts and watts in the cpu"
"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."
"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."
"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("
This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .
"This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.  I'm sure it will play all the latest games just fine. and If it doesn't I can just pop in a different proc."
"The Intel Core i9-14900K processor is a beast when it comes to gaming and multitasking. With its 24-core configuration (8 Performance-cores and 16 Efficiency-cores), this CPU handles everything from intense gaming sessions to heavy-duty content creation smoothly and without a hitch. The unlocked feature allows for overclocking, providing additional performance boosts as needed. Integrated graphics are a great addition, capable of handling basic video tasks and supporting displays without the need for a separate GPU. This processor consistently delivers high speeds and reliable performance, making it a top choice for anyone building a high-end PC. Whether you're gaming at the highest settings, streaming, or juggling multiple intensive applications, the i9-14900K stands up to the challenge."
This thing is a beast! Very powerful indeed.  Works flawlessly. I just finished building my desktop computer.  Very joyful to have and to play with.  I am very happy with the CPU.
"Overall this processor has worked well. I have had some minor issues with the PC crashing while playing games and I have not been able to pinpoint root cause. However, after doing some research, I did find that there are known issues with this processor. Had I known this prior to purchasing, I probably would have purchased a cheaper and more stable processor. Do your research prior to purchasing."
"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days."
It is very fast but it also runs very hot when running at full load. Be sure to build with a liquid cooler.
"Be careful with cooling. Try to keep under 75 celcious, so water cooling is the best option here. Great performance and stability is achieved under 75 degrees. Using it for 3d graphic rendering. 5 stars."
"In 2020 I made the mistake of switching to AMD. The system I built was so annoying. The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed. Slowed everything down and made a lot of unnecessary noise. With my new Intel-based system, those issues are gone, and I have a lightning fast PC. Learned my lesson about AMD!"
The only reason I knocked down the rating under value for the money is because I feel Intel is charging too much for this product. But hey that's just my opinion. Anyways. Good product. Puts AMD to shame is all ways again in my opinion.
"Great processor, well packaged. I like the wafer case. Very protected. Top of the line speed and quality"
Works great in new build! Only slight issue is I felt like there wasn't quite enough thermal paste... I had some leftover from a previous build so I added some additional just to be safe.
"The CPU is really strong for both gaming and video-editing/movie creation. Haven't had any issues within the past 6 months I've had this. Never gave any issues, no malfunctions and it never stutters and this is without O.C. the CPU."
I was afraid to purchase the 14th gen after all the talk of stability issues. When the the Bios fixes were mentioned I took a shot. I'm up and running with the power limits adjusted accordingly.
"Awesome CPU, and an absolute beast!I did not, however, recieve my code for Star Wars Outlaws. Amazon says it's an Intel thing, yet you cannot contact Intel to ask. Any ideas?"
"This processor has way better memory controller then my previews 12900k for my DDR4 clocking at 3950 MHz at 15-15-15-30 timing error free. I had heard about the 14900k has crashing issues so far I have no issues with Unreal Engine 5 games, Tekken 8, Battlefield 2042, etc, etc.... My cpu is running 59 GHz all P cores @ 1.35v limited power P1 and P2 @ 253 Watts, therefore, won't over heat and degrade the  silicon of my 14900k,  55Â° average temperature on gaming with a good cooler MSI MEG Core Liquid S360 - AIO at full speed push and pull fans. All my games runs extremely smooth at high frame rates with no stuttering."
"Still love Intel despite their lack of anything groundbreaking recently. CPUâs still work great for gaming, this one included. Works right out the box and went perfect with my new MSI motherboard too."
I was able to get 240fps in CS go and valorant without external GPU.I previously had 6th gen i7 and GTX980. And that couldn't pull this.Lightroom rendering is also good i am able to color correct 100 raw pics in seconds.I didn't expect this performance when i updated.
Even running at the default 6.1ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing.  Only way to stop it is to go in bios and set the core ratio to 57 max for power cores and 43 for efficency cores. Drove me nuts trying to figure out the problem for months also buy a hefty duty power supply if you're buying a 40 series rtx graphics card constant crashing of apps and games from lack of power to the graphics card from even a 1000 watt supply
"It's a processor. It's like any other processor that processes, only better.It destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in Corel Painter. It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code.Just remember to update your BIOS because it's still a relatively new processor. And stay away from Windows 11."

While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."
I'm using this as a server CPU mostly for the SR-IOV capable GPU stability has been an issue when running windows VM's on proxmox but in light of recent news about mainboard MFG's pushing the CPU too hard out of the box that may be the source of my stability issues as I mostly left the settings OOB for the CPU
"Switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super.. this is one heck of a cpu. I only put a $60 280mm aio ""I'd cooling"" and put it on smart fan. After that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99% GPU usage in every game. Jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on. Which is unheard of from everything I read. Totally glad I went with this over 7800x3d. Mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle I wanted. My newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling.. Thanks to this cpu at its core."
"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste."
"Upgrading from a 10700KF to 14700K. Lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but Iâm here to tell you itâs well worth the money! Just make sure to go to your BIOS and limit the power to 253W. The whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion. I havenât gotten heat issues while gaming.Overall I have this chip paired with a 3090, while Iâll wait for a new 50 series card.Some of the gains Iâve gotten at @1440P, 45 in ultra wide 21:9, max graphics settings:Overwatch: overall 50fps gain, consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor.Black Desert Online: overall 35-40 fps gains.These are the games I normally play a lot and itâs truly notice when upgrading to this chip. Overall the computer is a snappy and fast and havenât notice any hiccups. Really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4-5 years."
Terrific performer for my needs.  Runs fast and pretty cool
My husband built me a computer from scratch because my old one was to slow for him. The I7 was the last thing I needed. It was easy for him to install. It performs fantastic.
"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."
Perfect
This 14th generation Intel Core i7 is a powerful and fantastic processor for a desktop gaming build.The product is well packaged with some assembly instructions that are easy to follow. I heartily recommend this computer processor for DIYs and computer enthusiasts.
I upgraded from an i9 - 11900K.  Pretty good performance increase on benchmarks.  I haven't gamed on it yet (still in the process of locking down cables and loose hardware)MB GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS PRO X
"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80â° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"
"The processor is great and arrived sealed in good condition, however, the cardboard box had no protection and it could easily be damaged if it fell."
Able to compile rust code way faster now.
Was using amd cpu untill now. Cpu died in 2 year only. Now back to intel. Dad of AMD .
Product is good Price is high wait for prices to go down dont buy overpriced products. It's gives seller more power over us.
"|The media could not be loaded.|I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers."
"Broken, just found out. Missed return window by 3 days"
"I purchase this CPU 1 year ago and it cost me 74,000 JPY back then.the price didn't drop much since that time and the performance is satisfying so far.the new generation spec is higher so if you want to buy this CPU don't. instead, you can buy i7 Gen13 as it will have the same spec plus a better cache than the 12 Gen.it might be better to buy the K version in case you have issues with your GPU to troubleshoot."
Bought for a friend's computer I was building. I got it in the Prime sale and it's fantasticly fast
This CPU has 24 threads and 16 cores (8E cores and 8P cores) which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issuesDoesn't cause a CPU and GPU bottleneck as I only get about 45% GPU usage and stay under 10% load in most AAA titles like Destiny or Call of Duty.CinebenchR23 BenchmarksUsing CINEBENCH R23 I got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70 % of top performing CPU score of  43640.Using Geek Bench 6 testI got a Single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83 % of top performing CPU score of  3097 And a multi-core score of 12821 which is roughly 56 % of top performing CPU score of  21742
I used this to upgrade a system I built two years ago.  I was going t use a 14th gen i9.  but for all the issues I have heard and read about with the 13th and 14th gen i9's having I went safe route.  I hate to have a computer crash cause of manufacture intel 13th and 14th gen i9 defects!!!!
This CPU has been put into my Unraid server so I could take advantage of the onboard video for Plex.  My previous AMD system I need a discrete graphics card to do the same thing.  This new CPU worked perfectly for my use case.
Very good
love it fast easy to install would buy again if i  need one

"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7."
Make sure you have a good Aio  NOT an msi core liquid v2 360 because that one died on me and this was seeing 80-90c idle other than that this processor is pretty good when its cooled properly.
"It's not the latest gen but an overclocked I9 12th gen is more than enough for almost any gaming.  Overclocked it does demand some serious cooling, but anyone who overclocks would expect that."
"Works great in my new system. I wouldn't say easy to install, but none are, I always sweat bullets when I latch down the CPU holder. But other than that stable and powerful.

"Low binned CPU, bad CPU score"
"This thing never goes over 15 percent usage, and most games its actually using 0-4 percent. Even on Escape From Tarkov at max settings 4k 140+ fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0-1 percent, I don't know if it's my computer reading an error but I use a few apps to check including the task manager tab. I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail,  Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage. My GPU barely works as I have a 3090 TI, my GPU is usually at USAGE 40-50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool, so I don't think anything is bottle necking.My old computer has an I5 and I have a laptop with an I7 and when I am gaming they are usually at 90+ percent usage. Even my friend with the AMD 5800x3D was getting at least 30+percent usage for AAA games. This is the first Computer I've built where I'm actually not even worried about the CPU for how cool it runs. I'm really shocked on how good its performance is, Definitely recommend."
Just a quick swap from a I5 to this on a 660 moboNoticed a difference right away in cities skylines 2That's all I needed
"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load)."
"Faster Read, Write speeds than I-7. Easy Install. I recommend a Liquid cooler if you Overclock--otherwise the revved Fan noise will irritate you.I returned one -new unopened because the Motherboard I ordered for it arrived Damaged."
Is 50c high?  Feels like it to me... under really heavy loads barley his 60. I have liquid cooling cpu & gpu aids and 9 fans.  Still seems high IDK
"Had a 11900K prior to this one, and as fast as it was even being overclocked to 5.3 ghz - the 12900K is just simply better. Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny."
"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling."
"It took me less than 15 minutes to take out my current 1700 series CPU (i7 12700K) and add in this new one.  Removed the AIO cooler, cleaned off the thermal paste, applied new past after inserting and wala' it's up and running like a champ.  I'm not a gamer, so yes I understand it's not a huge bump in performance for those applications. Video Editing is another story."
"Are usually go for the best products and it was a mistake for my first PC build I chose this chip and I didnât know it runs that hot I built my PC I had enough fans but I had a 240 mm radiator I want a Micro Center and had to get a 360 mm cooler from the pool. The temps were at 89 to 92Â°C after the deep cool AIO under stress, test and bench testing the temp stay under 60Â°C , other than that I game hard on it and stream and the CPU usage never goes past 30%. Itâs pretty overkill but thatâs how I like my PC."
works perfectly under load. work mostly on architecture and rendering
"Purchased this for my new rig as opposed to an i7 based on price point at time of purchase (this was actually cheaper than the i7).Paired with RTX 4060TI 8GB.NO regrets.This can handle anything I throw at it, without issue (gaming wise) and never goes above 50/55C (not overclocked and cooled with 240MM AIO from Corsair) Idles around 32/33CVery responsive with plenty of clearance if I ever want to OC this guy.Heat was a concern after reading reviews and only having a 240MM radiator (sitting over a 4060Ti), but no issues - heat or performance) at all.Great time to buy with new gen just arriving recently."
If someone ever asks you 'what is a GPU bottleneck' buy them a 12900k lmao.It's so good.
"I love the Intel i9 unlocked processor. I have always used Intel and will continue to do so. All of my games operate smoothly, the graphics are amazing used with the correct moniter and Gpu. In my opinion Intel beats Ryzen hands down."
"Came packaged kinda poorly, and didnât include the golden coin case, which makes me think maybe it was pre owned. When I opened the packaging though it had no paste on it and the pins looked brand new, so maybe they just donât include it anymore since it isnât the newest flag ship??"
I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming. The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming. I highly recommend this processor or anything in the 12th gen Alder Lake family.Full System Specs:ã»ASUS Prime Z690-Aã»Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Blackã»Intel Core i9-12900K 5.2GHzã»NVIDIA RTX A5000 24GB ECCã»G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB 5600MHzã»Samsung 980 PRO 2TB M.2 NVMeã»Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMeã»Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMeã»Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMeã»EVGA Super Nova G5 850W 80 Plus Goldã»Fractal Torrent Gray E-ATX Mid Tower Case
"Using this to serve movies and shows using PLEX, handles continuous recording of several 4K surveillance cameras using Blue Iris, runs a web server (just for family), and controls a Z-wave home automation program involving several nodes. I also use it listen to my collection of music. It does all of these tasks (along with other minor things) without a sweat. Generally it keeps under 15% utilization. Thank you Intel!"
"the CPU run fast and stays cool, the performance was great ,test run at 5.2Ghz the temperature not over heat.run with my  solidworks software that cpu was great."
"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future.The packaging is a keeper to be sure, too."
This thing was so patient with me as I turned it on without a cooler several times because my pump was failing. Sure it shut off when it hit ~102 Celsius but there was no long term damage and now it serves me well with a working pump. We love to see it.
"Bought this CPU on sale, and it runs fast and stays cool. Mine is running at 5.2 ghz with temps in the 40's on AIO on an ASRock Z790m ITX. I am super impressed at this combination of speed and reasonable temps. Have not gamed yet, but I expect killer performance!!"
"It's great, I'm using 13900k but wanted a better cpu for my 2nd PC, and it's great, especially for compute tasks and multi-threaded workloads. The raptor lake,  and forthcoming, will of course be better, but if you need the best Alder Lake CPU and can find a decent deal, it won't let you down. I'm able to cool it efficiently with a Noctua N-14 (single stack, single fan setup) and it works great."
Bought on sale.My rig placed in the 97 percentile. The pc is overclocked.The processor is running cool and stable. No issues yet.Would recommend
"This CPU is top quality, it is easy to install and works great for gaming, it stays cool and I have had no problems with it."
"I've only had it about a month, but so far it is complete overkill for gaming... I haven't seen it go above 50% pushing it as hard as I can other than stress testing lol. I bought it so hopefully in 10 years it can still do some stuff hahaha."
It's been less then 24hrs since I upgraded from an i7-8700 and could instantly tell a difference in performance. Haven't had the need to overclock since it handles streaming on twitch/kick with obs while playing games on the same PC very nicely at stock settings.
"I bought it with price lower than I7-13700, which was very good choice and happy with the decision"
I was going to go for the 13900k but I took this one for half of the price and have to tell u love it thank you
"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250."
"many cores, able to run multiple virtual machines with unnoticeable slowdown to other functions. Stays at 1-3% when playing games paired with a  3070. May upgrade to 13th gen later, but i really can't complain in terms of performance. Only have a dualfan/dual heatsink cpu cooler and it stays below 60 celsius at all times. Rests at about 30."
"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen."
Fast shipping and great product
This CPU is power hungry under load but in games the CPU is fast. This also works fine for workstation workloads but this shines in gaming for sure. Also if you have the cooling this CPU can be clocked even higher for better performance. But for this you will need a decent CPU cooler.
"Now has a thin film over it. Donât know how it receives electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard, probably similar to wireless charging, but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while handling the CPU during the build. After all CPU is the most or second mot expensive component in a PC build.Other than that, the increase in core count and speed, couple with gen 4 SSD and RTX 3090 ti, everything else is just slow"
"Received at least a week earlier than the scheduled assessment for delivery.Not installed yet but if you look at video reviews I'm sure you know this processor is going to preform when you need it as a creator.At the moment I'm still using a 2010 year,  i7  that endured the test of time in a properly built computer.Now it's time for the i9 12900K LGA1700 creator build computer to handle photography & video production in 2022."
great price easy to install
"Aside from the nightmare Alder Lake is with ram clocking, this thing does everything you need to. Consistently hits 5.1 - 5.2ghz when needed.Don't listen to the AMD fanboys who try to slander this chip for its heating. I literally just have a 240mm AIO and it doesn't go above 78Â° and when gaming never even touches 70Â°. Just do 5 seconds of research on a half decent air cooler or AIO and you're fine with temps"
"This unit is powerful for all of your needs. Just remember this thing runs really hot!!! Make sure you use a good cooling system. Otherwise, you will have thermal throttling issues."
Good
I bought this thinking it came with the whole case and everything but it came in a cheap little box that was half crushed.
This is the fastest processor I've ever owned and with it I upgraded my entire pc.  Even though I purchased last years model it's still extremely fast and works well.. Make sure you pair this with a good motherboard otherwise it can run pretty hot.
Could is great but. Boy does she put off some heat. Feels like a furnace under my desk
"This cpu is killer and can literally handle any game you throw at it on max settings, and the same can be said for most workload programs. However I bought it back in early 2022, when it was still way overpriced for what it is now"
Awesome Cpu blazzzing fast !!!!!!  for gaming and other  tasks . i see that the temps for this cpu work up into the 70's and even higher 80 + my recommendation is to undervote your cpu if your just gaming that will lower temps. With good thermal paste Kingpin cooling KPX and a water cooler im getting 55-58c in gaming hope it helps.
"Really fast for gaming, excellent speeds. Intel Driver software is nice too."
Great Processor
The processor is amazing. Upgraded from an Intel 8700k.  Paired it with 6400 mhz DDR5 memory on a AsRock z690 Taichi motherboard  and my Nvidia EVGA 3080Ti and I'm consistently in the top 5% of benchmarks world-wide with barely any tweeks except selecting the XMP profile in my bios. Blows away anything currently AMD is offering in the same price range.
Not sure if I bought the best in terms of value and performance!
supper fast works just grate
"There's nothing more to say, if you only want gaming get an i7, unless you're into emulation that's the only instance where you'll get an actual edgeIt runs pretttty hot as it takes over 250 watts if it can, in my case over 270 so keep that in mind"
I found this on sale for $350. A 12th gen i9 for a comparable price to an i7 I mean the review writes itself couldnât have been more excited to get such a great cpu for such a competitive price.
"Very excited to get up and running, came in OG box sealed. Took a long time to get but very pleased"
This was a huge upgrade to my system for good price. Im back into the modern pc world. Win 11 runs great
This thing is truly impressive. It also comes in a very shiny golden container. It makes you happy the moment you open the package. As far as I have researched this is the absolute best and most powerful processor on the market as or 9/6/2022. I definitely recommend.
"I love this processor, it can handle anything I throw at it. The only thing I was concerned with, is that I bought it 'new', but the stickers were peeled off the Intel 12900k box, so I am not sure what was up with that, it looked like it still had the safety seal on it though, but at least it works."
"I'm very satisfied with this processor, I've used Intel for many years now and I've never had any problems with them. Looking back when I first started computer gaming, I was gaming on a 386 dx66 that I bought from Mongomery Wards...lol.."
"It will handle all your multitasking needs with ease, even while gaming.Only con I can think of is that it does run very hot so you'll need a high end cooler to get the best performance"
This processor is all-rounder for every tasks you do on PC from small to CPU intensive applications. If you are looking for vast performance with heavy production tasks this is very nice to have. Best to use with Motherboard DDR5 and PCI-E 5.0 supported motherboards.
Thanks ð
"It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80Â°C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80Â°C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80Â°c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors."
good
It's not Amazon's issue but the processor I bought is faulty. I'm experiencing crashes while playing games. It's so annoying and so time-consuming. I had so many stressful moments because of this.
very good cpu.
"I love it, works great. I paired this with 128GB using G.SKILL Ripjaws S5 Series (Intel XMP 3.0) DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 5600MT/s CL28-34-34-89 1.35V Desktop Computer Memory UDIMM - Matte Black (F5-5600J2834F32GX2-RS5K), this is the fasted 5600 MT/s DDR5 I could find on Amazon at the time of purchase and I specifically chose the 5600 MT/s because as it is advertised on Intel's website for the i9-13900k. It works really good, very very fast, and can ***multi task heavy software like they're nothing*** and with a push pull AIO it averages around 28*C and when I'm gaming it stays around 50-40*C with graphics maxed out. Much love and gratitude to Intel! This works great with gaming and also data science, which work is the main reason I bought this. I also used the Thermal Grizzly - KryoSheet (38x38x0,2mm) for this as well so I don't have to worry about paste drying up on my i9 <3 and lemmy tell you it fits PERFECTLY and pairs well with a CPU contact frame too, and after almost half a year I've yet to have any problems, only good results."
"It did not come with the box in the image, it came with a standard box like the i7"
After 3 months it appeared that my processor is faulty. I discussed the issue with Intel support and they happily agreed to replace it with a new one. But I still had to discuss this with the reseller. They have a very bad support and hardly answer my messages time to time with short sentences.

Super
Donât buy from this seller.  This company sells faulty products.  The courier charge to return the faulty product to USA is very expensive!!
"Upgraded this 13900K from an i7 12700K. It is pretty fast when handling 3d applications.It does generate a lot of heat, but still works ok with CPU air-cooling tower fan."
"So I am no tech guru or anything.  I cannot delve into the technical nuances of this cpu like some can.  What I can tell you is this.  The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity.  Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work.  Yes I know this CPU runs notoriously hot, but it seems a good quality AIO tames it well.  I have the 13900k running on an Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master X motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and I use the NZXT Kraken 360 Elite to cool it.  The Kraken Elite does manage the heat well and my systems idles at 28-29 degrees.  This CPU is way overkill for a gamer, but for someone like me that does a lot of 3D modeling and rendering, its great.  I do have the cpu slightly overclocked using the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility in automatic overclock.  I have not had any crashes and havent noticed any thermal throttling at all with this setup."

"Very stable & capable, video edit/render."
"This thing is a beast. I don't even need to overclock it. It's amazing how fast it can actually do everything I throw at it. 3D rendering, zipping folders, Unreal Engine 5.0 works, installing big softwares..anything. Add a liquid cooling system and this thing will do anything you ask it to without problems."
"It worked fine for 6 months, then i start running into Error Code 0xC0000005 with lots of various applications in Windows 11.  I figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing, and I dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues.  I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues.  I try replacing the memory, still issues.  I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues.  I try windows 10.... still issues.  I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code.  They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky."

quality go on!
"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU."
"I initially got a 13700K, but grabbed this after and snubbed the 14 gen. I upgraded from 8700K, ***which is still a very capable cpu even today, but due to the demands of certain programs the 13900K is handling them better than the 13700K so far.Fingers crossed to hoping it will not fail in future. There are well documented power issues that Intel and their partners have with the 13th, 14th gen. May be an upsell to the upcoming ultra line of cpus?So you have to take this into account and modify your motherboards bios, and follow Intel's suggested settings.I will update this review if anything else comes up."
"Iâm running a 360 AIO, under volted. Idle temp 25Â°C Underload it doesnât get above 60c. Renders out projects really fast."
"We set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday - to make a long story short, we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7-11th gen we had from before.The surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines, we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others.  We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.  This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  This is a huge surprise.  These systems had no GPU, only motherboard, 64GB of DDR5, and an SSD.  Has anyone else seen this?"
"Got it for my gaming machine, but all my games crashed when trying to play."
"I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset.  It didn't boot when I set it all up.  It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU.  Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint.A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.  They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.  So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great."
"This CPU unit is a beast, upgraded from a i7 8700k...the improvement was HUGE. Doubled my FPS in WoW, and there is no more lag! Nevertheless, after 6 months of regular use, it started failing...many kernel errors until it finally became useless. I could, somehow, return it to INTEL (from PerÃº to USA). Great support outside US...but such a complex and expensive unit cannot fail that quickly without heavy usage, at least in my opinion."
"I really like this CPU and it has worked well for my needs. Many had the issue of overheating, throttling and even bending in some instances. I have not experienced any of this since I knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the BIOS to keep this monster CPU running cool. It seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues. All you need to to is look up the specs for your CPU and setup the BIOS of your motherboard accordingly.I am using the Aorus Waterforce X 280 with Artic MX-6 Thermal Paste just in case you are curious. This has also been installed on the GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX motherboard.As long as you set this up correctly you will not have any issues and will get a great performing CPU."
"Like the title says and all the reviews say, this thing is a beast.  Make sure you have a good cooling solution lined up.  Even without overclocking this puppy will handle anything I've thrown at it with ease.  But like all the reviews you see online say, it puts out some serious heat.  I've had it for about 4-5months now, before it started cooling off outside I was have to crank the A/C to keep my gaming room cool and now that its cooling off outside (30-40 f at night) I have blocked off the vents in the room to prevent any additional heat.  This thing paired with a RTX 4090 keeps this room plenty warm enough for me!  So on the plus side, I'll be saving on heating this winter!!"
"When it comes to going over the top for a PC upgrade, this CPU is the undisputed heavyweight champion. I, too, dabble in video editing, 3D modeling, and an array of demanding tasks, and let me tell you, this powerhouse just devours them with sheer gusto. Paired with a Kraken water cooler, it operates like a well-oiled machine, showing absolutely no signs of throttling, even under the most intense workloads. And as for those so-called ""CPU-intensive"" games, well, they might as well be child's play for this beast. If you're seeking the best of the best, look no further â this CPU is the crown jewel in the kingdom of processors, and it's here to make your computing dreams come true. It's not just top-tier; it's top of the world, and it laughs in the face of anything you throw its way. A true marvel of technology that's worth every penny!"
"I did end up returning it because of a motherboard issue. I do have a 12900k, and many other types and they all perform as expected. I would recommend Intel processors to those looking for something for general all around performance. As the 14900k and 13900k are basically the same, I would say get this one unless you can find the 14900k for the same price."
"This processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card. I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesnât generate that much heat either. I previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4K so sadly I had to retire my old build. Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, donât be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you donât want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent. Good luck gamers and editors. Just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor. AMD processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do."
"Using Phantek Glacier D30 360mm cooler, during heavy stress load it gets around 82-84C. Just gaming in heavy modded Skyrim, FFXIV, and Total Warhammer 3 stays around 50-55C.Those complaining about temps higher than that while just gaming likely do not have their cooler mounted properly or too low end of a cooler.Make sure coolers plastic film is removed from metal block if it has that, apply plenty of thermal paste if cooler doesnt come pre applied with any, and evenly screw on the mounting screws to keep pressure as evenly as possible till all are set."
"This was bought for my son's custom build gaming  computer.Only a few weeks in, but I haven't heard any complaints from him."
this is a beast of a CPU this thing destroys anything you can throw at it.can download surf the netwhile gaming and it doesnt bat a eye.and she runs much cooler than the tubers are showingturn your volts to 1.37v and done. Amazing power !!!
"Itâs so good, and that makes sense since itâs top of the line right now (imagine that.) Going from my 9900k to this was like a spiritual enlightening but ALSO I must add this is totally unnecessary unless youâll be working with heavy loads, unreal engine, 4k video editing and streaming, 4k gaming, or anything that requires overclocking.Buying this bad boy will future proof your computer for now, BUT there are very few people who NEED this kind of cpu. If youâre shopping for your build right now and considering this, if itâs in the budget and you want something thatâll handle literally whatever you want then yes, this is great. But just remember, whatever you want might not be as intense as this thing accounts for.Now that Iâve warned you about not needing this; let me just say how happy I am that I got it. I do a lot of 4k editing and streaming and there is no issue, runs smoothly and efficiently (does get hot though) if youâve got a good cooler on this then youâll be good to go for a long time."
"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.  Don't overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 C."
Love this cpu super fast only complant is the imc of my chip sucks cant get over 7000mhz stable but thats fine i swapped my 7200mhz 32gb kit out for 64gb 6400mh z kit and tightend the timing great gaming cpu fast at all tasks ill probably stay with intel for now unless amds cpus get an equivalent transcode to intels integrated graphics
"This thing puts enough heat out to power a thermal generator, and I really am not kidding. Water cooling ONLY unless you want to melt your board or destroy the high dollar part. I would also recommend a large radiator too, 3 fan coverage. This thing is an excellent space heater.Outclasses thread ripper by almost double its paces per benchmarking in multicore. Handles everything I throw at it then yawns at me as if it was boring and mediocre work.Simply put, leader of the pack right now and handles literally anything Iâve tried to hit it with, even running multiple games at once (when combined with a good GPU, naturally).I have zero complaints. Iâve learned to hate a lot of intel items over the years, but this truly is a marvel."
"Installation is easy. It does run a little hot so you need a good cooler. I use a dedicated all-in-one water solution from corsair, and the package temp never exceeds 75."
"As per benchmarks, this CPU performs way better than AMD 7950x3D. Although, you will just get 3-4 frames higher while gaming in AMD 7950x3D CPU but what's the point? Intel is still leading in single core score! Power consumption is almost same. Intel is Apple and AMD is Android. End of story!"
"Excellent processor. It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one.Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100Â°C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67Â°C) but is something to be aware of.All in all happy with this beast"
the delivery went well and arrived on time. the product conforms and meets my needs.
"Probably more than what I need for gaming, maybe I should have gotten a 13700k instead to run a little cooler.  This gets HOT on my Dark Rock Pro 4.  I want to get a 360mm AIO to help cool this.  I ruined a motherboard trying to use a contact frame, afraid to use one again.  Contact frame went in the trash, so another motherboard would not.  Using the stock CPU holder/ loading mechanism."
"If it have the money to spare and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) its a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it to most users.If you're just using the PC as a high-end gaming rig an i7-13700k is more than enough even with a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the cheaper 13700k. Also this processor is notoriously hot, so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm+ watercooler AIO is necessary (especially for overclocking)."
EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
"The Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor is just a fantastic super-fast processor that does have 24 cores when needed for heavy applications. Get yourself an AIO cooler like the Artic Freezer II 360 size and you're all set. No real need to overclock this CPU. It also works great for heavy applications and gaming. Has plenty of fast L 3 cache on die so there's no delay or speed issues. It also runs my Team Group DDR 5 7800Mhz ram with no problem on my Maximus Z790 Hero chipset Motherboard. Wanted to get the EVGA Z790 Kingpin motherboard but it sells out very fast within minutes.Great CPU and I'm very happy that I've bought the Intel 13900K. Hands down, this will be a great for 5-6 years to easily and maybe longer."
Run smoothly and cool.  Great value
"My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases. Unacceptable for a company worth over $100B to push out a product like this."
"i9-13900K or KF. Fast install onto a Supermicro Board x13SAE-f with server memory with IPMI for remote access or an Asus Board such as Z690-f with DDR5 where you can buy an IPMI attachment, and it throttles rather than crashes when it overheats. Or just for gaming and office use this CPU beats everything else to date.  Buy one now and if you have an i9-12900K or KF sell it. Pay attention to the necessary new BIOS install. Not one crash to date but occasional throttling down when stressed as CPU temperature gets too high occurs now and again but not very often and sure stronger Air Fan or water cool fix that if it bothers you. Same thing happens on my more than twice the price Thread Ripper 3970x and not a big deal. This a server class CPU."
"If youre going with an AIO get a 360mm cooler. I tried using a 240mm and it just wasnt enough to cool the CPU during some Starfield. That out of the way, this thing is seriously impressive. Even with how un optimized some of these new games are, I have never seen anything use it beyond 80% other than some CPU specific tasks."
It works as intended. Needed the upgrade.
I had an issue with my computer not posting and after taking it to Best Buy for a diagnostic report; I was told that my motherboard or cpu was bad. I sent both back. Turns out it was the motherboard not the cpu that was the issue. Even though they are entitled to up to 20 or so percent as a stocking fee they were generous enough to give me a full refund. I appreciate this kind of service and hope you wont hesitate to reach out if you have an issue.
"Took me forever to figure this out, but I can't reach rated speeds on my 13900k due to throttling.SP 111/88 = 103Cooling: 170When the throttle happens, both P-cores and E-cores drop, causing performance hits in normal tasks as well as games. ASUS motherboard at default settings attempts to send extreme amounts of voltage to the CPU (1.4+) in order to reach boost rating (no XMP).This has literally been the most difficult processor to reign in heat I've had to deal with in my 30 years of computing, AMD is starting to look good I guess (which is why I switched to and have remained with intel for 20 years, AMD ran hot back in the day). Apparently even the 14900k's are having issues.It's power hungryIt's hotNot enough surface area to cool appropriately without risking your warrantyLiterally every solution I've seen involves doing things Intel recommends against.Intel: Some help would be appreciated."
"It comes with CPU only in a box & without a Fan, so you need to buy an LGA1700 Fan Support, it running Quit Good, but not the Greatest yet for RTX 4090, 4080, because the GPU usage will reach 95-98, it doesn't go %99 all the times so there's a bit of CPU bottleneck even at 4K Resolution & it gets even worst CPU bottleneck in 1440p or 1080p, so i think the Core i9-14900K or 15900K will get the job done no CPU bottleneck, i used this with ASUS ROG Strix Z790-F Gaming DDR5 it works great!Thanks to the seller is Trusted!"
"I can't believe the price for what this thing does. I do photography, video and graphics. Not sure I will ever use its full potential. With water cooling this thing runs super cool.

Extremely fast processor. Moved from a 12900kf. Much faster RAM clocks without the issues the 12900kf was giving me.I have been using the processor for a while now with no issues and great thermals on a watercooled system. The processor stability has been rock solid even with a bios updated 12th gen motherboard.

"This CPU is insanely fast for both gaming, but also productivity. Right out of the box with default settings, my 13900K scored over 40000 points on Cinebench R23 multicore test. For max power uses like Cinebench or Blender, it pushes my 360mm AIO cooler to it's limits, but for gaming it rarely gets above 60*C. I use a Thermalrite contact frame, and Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste for max cooling effectiveness. Overall, very pleased with my purchase and plan to use this CPU for many years to come."
"Mega powerful.  Thought mine was bad so ordered a new one, turns out it was my motherboard and RAM combo. (Aorus Master, Asus ROG Strix-E, and different types of RAM)I've returned the second CPU as it didn't perform as well as my original one once my system was up and running. These things aren't cheap!These things absolutely crush any task you throw at them."
|The media could not be loaded.|This cpu will give you all the juice you need for that sweet ultra 4k gaming i recommend either a noctua dh-15 as Air cooling solution for this cpu since it can run hit under heavy load i dont recommend an AIO but i do recommend a custom loop if you know what you are doing its very worth for this cpu other than this have fun gamers
"Installed on my full white build with ASUS ROG MAXIMUS Z690 FORMULA works without any problems, I had the bios 2103 now 2403 works flawlessly. It's fast but I noticed a little more on the hot side I get 35-45 idle and 50-60 during MW2. I have the NZXT Z73 cooler.First time I ran AIDA64 it failed saying hardware failure, second and consecutive  times it ran at 80ish but below 90"
"Well, what can I tell you, it is simply the best processor of 2023, you have to have an idea of ââwhat you are going to use it for, it is a big beast that is not worth it for small fights."
Hot ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥
This processor produces too much heat. Forget obout overclocking (I tried Intel utility). In overclocked mode the processor consumes over 300W and heats to over 100C even with the best cooler. Without overclocking it consumes about 250W and heats up to 89C under the full load (which is acceptable).
Bought it for gaming. It does what I need.
"It's great, 24 cores 32 processors.I was able to spin up about 6 different Virtual machines with no lag 4 cores each, or delay on switching between each virtual machine AND on dual monitor.The best of the best for a reason."
"I had I core7-7700k 7Ge, so I changed some components because they were already 5 years old, and I wanted to update to windows 11 so I had to changed the cpu so I decided for this i9 of course I had to changed then the motherboard the memory the cpu cooler and the case the rest was fine to work with the new components, now my pc itâs like a beastSo fast and powerful with the 990 pro, I love itâ¦"
"I use it for computation (not games) with a noctua d15 (1 fan). On all cores (some openmp stuff I wrote) it goes 5.1GHz on the performance cores and 4.1GHz on the efficient cores (in a 23C corner of a room). The temp moves between 90 and 100 C. How I handle that, emotionally, is to have enough in my bank account to get a 13600k overnighted. Having said that, I've been at it for a little over a month and there has not been a glitch. Paired with an asus strix 790-e."
This Cpu works great with the MSI Hero Z790 mobo. coupled with a MSI MEG coreliquid AIO Cpu Cooler i dont have any issues with the amount of heat this I9 puts out.
Reliable speedy productivity/gaming CPU
"I seriously doubt Iâll be replacing this in the next several years, if even that. This thing is a beast and handles everything you throw at it.Iâve put it through all of the usual hoops and it barely seems to notice. Iâve set it up with the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 420 A-RGB to deal with the heat and it handles that just fine.Worth your time and money, not a bad choice at all."
"Have been using this for less than a week. Amazing cpu, easy to install in your motherboard. Package appears more simpler compared to older model.Question: do you want an over built, beast of a cpu that you will likely not use to its full potential, but want the best of the best and your willing to pay a small premium compared to the slower model, but you're not some simp that wants something good but wants to dominate and laugh because you're cpu is better than all the ones out there?If the answer is yes, than please get this."
Built my new pc. Thermals on the chip were high. Over 100Â°c when benchmarking.Kept shutting down the system.Trouble shot my mobo/aio/bios for a couple days.Rralized it was a hot chip or a bad heat sensor in it.Got the new one today. 81Â°c  uder full load.Never know what ur gunna get.Now i get to wait 30 days for my money back.At least its sorted.
"Motherboard (Gigabyte z790 ud ac) not detecting cpuThe packaging was worst..Go to store instead, test it and buy it.Don't buy!"
I don't liked the price of it .I Also don't liked the performance of it .Rather you can purchase i9 13th generation
13 gen is better with same performence at low pricing. Avoid this product cause it have only 2 core touching 6000 mhz so in real life there are no difference.
What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money
Beast gaming world 2nd most powerful processor my set up has this processer and RTX 4070 16gb ram 2048gb(2tb) nvme m.2 ssd 850 watts pls buy it
"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen."
"Itâs very capable for modern gaming without disappearing the average user who games a lot. The stability is great. Itâs very fast, it never stutters, and doesnât disappoint. Itâs well worth the money. With a proper 360mm AIO cooler, it doesnât get too hot. I used an Asus TUF Gaming AIO cooler for gaming. Itâs pretty easy to install."
Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
"I just built a new gaming PC. MSI MAG Tomahawk motherboard, I9 14900k CPU, MSI Coreliquid S280 AIO, MSI 4090 Gaming X Trio, 2x WD Black SN850x SSDs, 64GB Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 RAM. It is a beast of a machine.CPU has never gone over 75c even playing games @ 4k, idle it sits around 40c. Gaming/rendering/photo and vidoe manipulation is effortless and super fast."
Core i7 14700kI was afraid the item to be made in Israel which willl leave me to returnBut my core came made in US and assembled in VeitnamRecommend to buy from the same seller
Not buying a cpu from this seller again wen my order came I opened the box and the cpu was not in the box even tho it still has the factory seal wast of almost 1k bucks
Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
Instead of buying i9 buy this and you will get 20 cores and safe alot of money
"Arrived earlier than expected, a very good Cpu. Expansive but what could we do."
"I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some.  I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good.  It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.Gaming seems fine, no issues.  I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!  Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around."
"Perfect CPU, fast and reliable.Fast delivery"
"I will test later.Send me invoice, please."
Does itâs job
"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."
"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"
"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."
I had to return it back the moment I saw on the box manufactured in IsrÃ¦lâ¦getting AMD instead
"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."
I dont know how to think about this information
"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."
"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."
"Lot of power, enough for any game, especially if you add APO from intel but you need a good cooler because these run hot !Ps: also deactivate in your BIOS the auto tunning if you have an high end motherboardâ¦ these are pumping insane volts and watts in the cpu"
"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."
"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."
"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("
This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .
"This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.  I'm sure it will play all the latest games just fine. and If it doesn't I can just pop in a different proc."
"The Intel Core i9-14900K processor is a beast when it comes to gaming and multitasking. With its 24-core configuration (8 Performance-cores and 16 Efficiency-cores), this CPU handles everything from intense gaming sessions to heavy-duty content creation smoothly and without a hitch. The unlocked feature allows for overclocking, providing additional performance boosts as needed. Integrated graphics are a great addition, capable of handling basic video tasks and supporting displays without the need for a separate GPU. This processor consistently delivers high speeds and reliable performance, making it a top choice for anyone building a high-end PC. Whether you're gaming at the highest settings, streaming, or juggling multiple intensive applications, the i9-14900K stands up to the challenge."
This thing is a beast! Very powerful indeed.  Works flawlessly. I just finished building my desktop computer.  Very joyful to have and to play with.  I am very happy with the CPU.
"Overall this processor has worked well. I have had some minor issues with the PC crashing while playing games and I have not been able to pinpoint root cause. However, after doing some research, I did find that there are known issues with this processor. Had I known this prior to purchasing, I probably would have purchased a cheaper and more stable processor. Do your research prior to purchasing."
"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days."
It is very fast but it also runs very hot when running at full load. Be sure to build with a liquid cooler.
"Be careful with cooling. Try to keep under 75 celcious, so water cooling is the best option here. Great performance and stability is achieved under 75 degrees. Using it for 3d graphic rendering. 5 stars."
"In 2020 I made the mistake of switching to AMD. The system I built was so annoying. The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed. Slowed everything down and made a lot of unnecessary noise. With my new Intel-based system, those issues are gone, and I have a lightning fast PC. Learned my lesson about AMD!"
The only reason I knocked down the rating under value for the money is because I feel Intel is charging too much for this product. But hey that's just my opinion. Anyways. Good product. Puts AMD to shame is all ways again in my opinion.
"Great processor, well packaged. I like the wafer case. Very protected. Top of the line speed and quality"
Works great in new build! Only slight issue is I felt like there wasn't quite enough thermal paste... I had some leftover from a previous build so I added some additional just to be safe.
"The CPU is really strong for both gaming and video-editing/movie creation. Haven't had any issues within the past 6 months I've had this. Never gave any issues, no malfunctions and it never stutters and this is without O.C. the CPU."
I was afraid to purchase the 14th gen after all the talk of stability issues. When the the Bios fixes were mentioned I took a shot. I'm up and running with the power limits adjusted accordingly.
"Awesome CPU, and an absolute beast!I did not, however, recieve my code for Star Wars Outlaws. Amazon says it's an Intel thing, yet you cannot contact Intel to ask. Any ideas?"
"This processor has way better memory controller then my previews 12900k for my DDR4 clocking at 3950 MHz at 15-15-15-30 timing error free. I had heard about the 14900k has crashing issues so far I have no issues with Unreal Engine 5 games, Tekken 8, Battlefield 2042, etc, etc.... My cpu is running 59 GHz all P cores @ 1.35v limited power P1 and P2 @ 253 Watts, therefore, won't over heat and degrade the  silicon of my 14900k,  55Â° average temperature on gaming with a good cooler MSI MEG Core Liquid S360 - AIO at full speed push and pull fans. All my games runs extremely smooth at high frame rates with no stuttering."
"Still love Intel despite their lack of anything groundbreaking recently. CPUâs still work great for gaming, this one included. Works right out the box and went perfect with my new MSI motherboard too."
I was able to get 240fps in CS go and valorant without external GPU.I previously had 6th gen i7 and GTX980. And that couldn't pull this.Lightroom rendering is also good i am able to color correct 100 raw pics in seconds.I didn't expect this performance when i updated.
Even running at the default 6.1ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing.  Only way to stop it is to go in bios and set the core ratio to 57 max for power cores and 43 for efficency cores. Drove me nuts trying to figure out the problem for months also buy a hefty duty power supply if you're buying a 40 series rtx graphics card constant crashing of apps and games from lack of power to the graphics card from even a 1000 watt supply
"It's a processor. It's like any other processor that processes, only better.It destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in Corel Painter. It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code.Just remember to update your BIOS because it's still a relatively new processor. And stay away from Windows 11."
"Case: GOPIE Micro ATX Case T07 (branded as ABIT on the case)Motherboard: MSI MAG B760m Mortar WIFI IICPU: I9 14900kCPU Cooler: ID-COOLING SE-207-XT SlimDDR5: 64Gb T-Team Create Expert 6000Mhz (4 x 32Gb)3 x m.2 Gen4: Lexar - 1 x 512GB (OS)/1 x 1TB/1 x 2TBSSD: 1 x 4TB CrucialCase Fans: Thermalright TL-9015B CPU Cooler Fan 92mm (2 x Intake Bottom/2 x Exhaust Top/1 x Exhaust rear)PSU: Montech Century Mini 750w GoldGPU: N/AThe I9 14900k is a beast and runs hot. While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."
I'm using this as a server CPU mostly for the SR-IOV capable GPU stability has been an issue when running windows VM's on proxmox but in light of recent news about mainboard MFG's pushing the CPU too hard out of the box that may be the source of my stability issues as I mostly left the settings OOB for the CPU
"Switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super.. this is one heck of a cpu. I only put a $60 280mm aio ""I'd cooling"" and put it on smart fan. After that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99% GPU usage in every game. Jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on. Which is unheard of from everything I read. Totally glad I went with this over 7800x3d. Mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle I wanted. My newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling.. Thanks to this cpu at its core."
"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste."
"Upgrading from a 10700KF to 14700K. Lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but Iâm here to tell you itâs well worth the money! Just make sure to go to your BIOS and limit the power to 253W. The whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion. I havenât gotten heat issues while gaming.Overall I have this chip paired with a 3090, while Iâll wait for a new 50 series card.Some of the gains Iâve gotten at @1440P, 45 in ultra wide 21:9, max graphics settings:Overwatch: overall 50fps gain, consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor.Black Desert Online: overall 35-40 fps gains.These are the games I normally play a lot and itâs truly notice when upgrading to this chip. Overall the computer is a snappy and fast and havenât notice any hiccups. Really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4-5 years."
Terrific performer for my needs.  Runs fast and pretty cool
My husband built me a computer from scratch because my old one was to slow for him. The I7 was the last thing I needed. It was easy for him to install. It performs fantastic.
"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."
Perfect
This 14th generation Intel Core i7 is a powerful and fantastic processor for a desktop gaming build.The product is well packaged with some assembly instructions that are easy to follow. I heartily recommend this computer processor for DIYs and computer enthusiasts.
I upgraded from an i9 - 11900K.  Pretty good performance increase on benchmarks.  I haven't gamed on it yet (still in the process of locking down cables and loose hardware)MB GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS PRO X
"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80â° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"
"The processor is great and arrived sealed in good condition, however, the cardboard box had no protection and it could easily be damaged if it fell."
Able to compile rust code way faster now.
"Easy to install if you know what you're doing. Be careful to not bend or break the pins. Apply thermal paste any way you like, thare is no ""best"" way - I go with an X pattern. The most important part is to ensure an even spread of paste on the dye, without any air gaps. You  can test how good your coverage is by applying the paste in any pattern you like, sit and press the cooler on the dye, then remove it and examine. If the spread/coverage looks good, clean the processor and cooler dyes, reapply paste, reseat and mount the cooler."
My use is gaming PC - that said the i9 14900k was a absolute amazing CPU for the first 2 months. My specs are as followsI9 14900k @5.6ghzH100i 360mm all in one idle 28c/underload 40c48gb 6000mhz ramMSI 3090ti Suprem X 24gbNow to begin with this was a beast of a CPU and then 2 months later without any updates going in that changed.MW3 was plagued with Directx Errors/constant crashes. Helldivers2 wouldn't boot. I was offline for 6 days which is alot of time trying to find a fault with your pc when you ain't finding it. I have now found a work around that makes games play but now the CPU has to be underclocked to handle games - I know this doesn't make sense but intel are aware of the defect and it affects the 13900k also.Be sure to have a good look online as I am looking to return mine to manufacturer due to not being as described. Having g to underclock it to be useful is not what I purchased.Good luck and I hope this review helps you!
Very pleased I got one of the golden exampleP core 6.1 and E core 4.6cinebench R23 42500+ score
I was expecting noise and heat issues using this CPU but I have not experienced any issues cooling this with my 360mm AIO cooler. I am also pleased with the performance.
"After reading so many reviews about the heat issues, I took the plunge and bought this, paired with the Noctua NH-U12A Chromax Black. All I can say is what a pairing - I do some heavy photo processing on Lightroom / Photoshop and some casual gaming and the processor temp range is anywhere between late 40 to 80 degrees which is pretty good.  Perhaps not the performance jump I was expecting moving from the old I7-4770K but that is probably more due to the poor optimisation on Lightroom."
Works perfect with H150i elite. No issues.
"For ""best CPU"" it has too much issues."
"Maybe a little expensive for some FPS stories, but if you have the money it's worth it!"
"Arrived without any delays, and works as intended. 7% better overall performance than 13900ks and clocks higher by 100 Mhz on both P and E cores.PS. keep in mind, it runs hot, and can easly overpower 360 aio's. Not great to pair up with z690 (At least from Gigabyte side) as their bios mis manages power delivery for those chips."
Runs hot. 105'c in Cinebench within seconds. Better off using the 13th Gen as the performance is almost identical and the temps are a little lower.
easy to install need a good cooler/aio and good airflow but happy with idle temps of 35c
You need an AIO to cool this beast because it gets very hot! Clock speeds hit 6.1ghz on idle at stock this is crazy!
Top Processor!
"- First order of this product was stolen in their werehouse, and a i3-12100f was shipped to me in the box of the i9- Second order of this product was the correct cpu shipped to me, however the cpu did not work, was dead on arrival.I have since bought a third this CPU from a local retailer and it works flawlessly.AVOID THIS RETAILER!"
