0.078,0.819,0.103,0.7371,the cpu is overall great for everything itll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming if you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy but the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler first of all i would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnt and also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting also the performance is not nice many would say stock cooler is more than enough for f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched  degrees so i took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going  to degrees and it was approx the same case while gaming idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling so be careful with the stock cooler or i would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like india where it gets to  degrees easily and you dont have an ac in your room aio is the choice,Positive,Positive

0.047,0.843,0.111,0.4391,it is a good processor to build a low budget computer in this processor you have to install a separate graphic card for the display i would also say that installing a cooler or a liquid cooler is also very important because this processor heats up more,Positive,Positive

0.035,0.833,0.131,0.9638,ive owned more expensive cpus  up to amd ryzen  and intel k in most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages most of the work i was doing offloaded everything to my gpu so having a beastly cpu was a wasteive downgraded to this cpu in my main desktop rig its great for productivity software music and design work as well as gaming i have it paired with a rtx  series card and havent noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming maybe  fps in most games i max out the monitors hzfps at pone different thing about this cpu over other intel offerings is that it has  performance cores with  threads  hyperthreading and no low powered efficiency cores they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery powerthe cpu is also very efficient and runs quite cool mine is c when idle and  light tasks such as browsing the web during gaming  the temps are usually in the mid s benchmarking such as cinebench and geekbench etc reaches mid s i am using a twofan deepcool as plus air cooler with three case mm fansall in all  very happy with purchase and highly recommend,Positive,Positive
0.006,0.819,0.175,0.9915,if is a th generation intel processor based on the alder lake architecture it stands out for its nm engraving its support for pcie  and thunderbolt  and its compatibility with ddr or ddr memory it is a processor without an integrated graphics circuit which involves the use of a dedicated graphics card the core if has  highperformance cores pcore and  threads thanks to hyperthreading technology it has a base frequency of  ghz and can reach up to  ghz in turbo mode it also has an mb l cache and a mb l cache the core if offers remarkable performance in applications and games it is proving capable of competing with higherend processors such as the ryzen  x from amd or the core ik from intel it is particularly good at tasks that make use of multithreading such as video encoding compression or rendering it also ensures optimal fluidity in the latest games even in high resolution the core if also stands out for its energy efficiency it has a base power consumption of  watts and a maximum power consumption of  watts   it is therefore easy to cool and does not require a cooling system that is too expensive or noisy it also reduces the electricity bill and the environmental impact so the core if is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful versatile and energyefficient processor it offers unbeatable value for money to take full advantage of the benefits of intels th generation however it requires a motherboard compatible with the lga socket and a dedicated graphics card,Positive,Positive

0.049,0.796,0.155,0.9995,as it should be instead of buying laptops and preassembled laptops a real nerd builds a computer himself and in addition to this he shares his experience in the ancient art of pc building also with friends and relatives my brother needed to use a computer and imagining the sadness of seeing him with a laptop a preassembled one or even worse with a mac i decided to build him a custommade computer and anyway what better way to convert someone to pc gaming than with a computer assembled with a lot of brotherly love so i decided to choose this processor because since it is a build primarily for school use  gaming and with a relatively limited budget ok brotherly love and everything but lets not exaggerate it seemed to me the best compromise between performance and quality in the end the seller sent me the f but i wanted the  so i made the return and i bought the  which in any case is identical apart from the integrated gpu and slightly higher frequencies so i can review it anyway since they are essentially the same processor it is a core thread processor which does not have the elusive ecores of the most expensive series for example the  has pcores like this plus ecores that help with background operations especially if you use windows  at a frequency of  ghz with a boost of up to  ghz if temperatures workload and your motherboard allow it a processor of this type excels in gaming but it doesnt suck even in the most complicated operations in fact this processor also performs very well in video editing with adobe premiere i combined it with a gigabyte rtx g and gb of ddr at mhz all on an asus bma prime performance and temperatures as i said before it is a midrange processor particularly suitable for gaming but which manages even the most professional operations without a hitch the architecture of these twelfthgeneration intel processors after a fairly disappointing eleventh generation is excellent without giving the numbers with benchmarks and other incomprehensible things i can tell you that in gaming it behaves at the same level as the good old ryzen  x undoubtedly the best midrange processor along with this one i dont think youll have problems with gaming or productivity using this processor provided the rest of the hardware is up to par i use it with trivial ddr at mhz so in terms of performance we are similar to the x i had on my build last year but if you combine it with a bit serious ddr it can certainly exceed it even if by a little bit in any case it performs very well in gaming especially when combined with a somewhat serious gpu like my rtx i havent noticed bottlenecks especially in the case of this build which will be used with a only p monitor as for temperatures this is a fairly quiet cpu with a tdp of only w at the moment i dont have a sink because it hasnt arrived so im using the stock sink included in the package i expected it would suck but its definitely acceptable temperatures do not exceed c in gaming even with heavy games while making the most of it with a cinebench it does not exceed c which is acceptable and well below the c throttling threshold even the sound of the original fan is quite low so well maybe ill keep it with the stock sink certainly however my case an nzxt with  additional fans helps a lot besides this i didnt trust the veil of preapplied thermal paste and i put my trusty gelid gc extreme in it because for a w processor with the dissi stock you certainly need an extreme level of thermal paste f version or not f tray or box integrated gpu the difference between the two versions lies in the availability of the integrated gpu the f version does not include it and it generally costs a little less depending on the difference in price consider whether to take one or the other i am not a fan of intel integrated gpus and i always try whenever possible to combine a dedicated gpu even if very scarce in this case i have the rtx which is a good gaming card so why did i want to get the processor with the integrated gpu because with certain programs that support intel quicksync technology the integrated gpu is not there to sleep but is actively used for video encoding or for other operations such as the timeline in premiere the little brother uses adobe premiere which can take advantage of this technology but other video editing or streaming programs also use it such as obs studio which can use the video encoder of the integrated gpu to trim leaving the dedicated gpu free for the game in any case the integrated gpu is the usual intel uhd on the  it is the uhd  on the  the  i havent tested it much in gaming but anyway dont expect who knows what the power of this is similar to the entry levels dedicated to laptops from a few years ago such as the m or so so its good for light games in any case it has no problems whatsoever when it comes to viewing videos or d images that are not particularly complex it can handle k videos on youtube or retro games and various emulators without problems as for other cryptic nomenclatures sometimes we see tray or box the difference between the two is the presence of a sink in the box version as i said above the cooler is poor but for a cpu like this it is sufficient if on the other hand you dont need it take the tray version should i take the   or  in my opinion among these three the best is the  and ill also explain why the  and the  are brothers while the  is in effect the superior model lets start with the  this processor has the same base as the  but with slightly higher base and boost frequencies as well as a slightly more powerful integrated gpu namely the intel uhd  against the  of the  higher frequencies essentially translate into a static improvement of an average of  more or less depending on the workload but practically never above  the integrated gpu is a little more powerful but it is always a very poor integrated one that is not suitable for gaming regardless if the price difference were about ten euros it could even be there but honestly i cant think of any reason why the  deserves to exist at almost  more avoid it i bought it only because i needed it in a hurry and the seller made a mistake in sending me the f instead of the  otherwise i would never have bought it the  on the other hand is on another playing field and is in effect the superior model as i said at the beginning in addition to the  pcores the  has  ecores as well as higher frequencies and the k version if you want to overclock for the price of almost  above  it could even fit you if its within your budget and you do intense multitasking or a lot of rendering operations in gaming they are practically the same the difference between the two can be perceived at high frame rates and low resolutions in aaa games perhaps in k you will be limited by the gpu in most cases in any case if you want to assemble a pc with a higher budget than mine and perhaps combined with a more powerful gpu than my  it could be worth it even if only because of the presence of ecores however i believe that the  is the sweet spot to consider for any midrange pc possibly considering an upgrade in a few years to the xxx generation when prices fall conclusion what can i say the  is a respectable cpu at a very affordable price among other things it is excellent in a midrange gaming build combined with a somewhat serious gpu and it doesnt work even in professional graphics programs used at an amateur or school level im definitely not telling you anything new but i fully recommend it for midrange builds and a low budget,Positive,Positive
0.029,0.812,0.16,0.797,switched from th gen i k to f i can feel the significant improvement especially with daily tasks and games it works perfectly i got ddr mhz cl ram as well works without a problem combined with  ti consumes such little power and gets everything i need done so fari got a noctua cooler for it though works really quiet and cool perfect for the price about sek cheaper than the version with integrated graphics but there are low profile gpus in case you want it as a simple daily or office use,Positive,Positive

0.167,0.745,0.087,-0.9827,ipurchased during prime day for  this processor carries  cores and  threads on its shoulders which although it may seem obvious has now become the standard for gaming lets not fool ourselves even if the starting clock is  ghz know that the motherboard activates the turbo boost and gets you up to  ghz as far as consumption is concerned in normal use it is below w w in the maximum games it recorded then it depends a maximum load of w under stress w precise net as stated by intel but now lets move on to the damn sore point that has been haunting these processors for years the heatsink i have tried several heatsinks and i must say that they have worked even if the pushpin system remains cumbersome it doesnt fit perfectly i know it seems strange to you but even if its not perfectly attached it still covers the entire dissipating surface you can rest assured ingame the maximum temperature i recorded with an ambient temperature of c was c then when i tried with an ambient temperature of c the temperature dropped to c they seem like high values but trust me that for a stock sink it does its dirty job for this reason i give it  stars update august    i have deactivated the intel turbo boost and now even when i play it never rises above c thus lowering the temperature by c even if you lose that  ghz know that it is equally powerful and you have no stability problems so im updating the review to  stars midaugust   update   the stock sink has abandoned me temperatures rose to c and then it goes under protection apparently it must be mounted perfectly or else it cant be done so im replacing it with a tower i dont recommend using that stock if you dont want to run into these unpleasant inconveniences update to  in the hope of not having any further problems,Negative,Negative

0.148,0.706,0.147,0.2338,the time of buying it i had doubts about whether it would arrive very badly treated since it is imported from amazon usa but it came in excellent condition they met the delivery time and i had absolutely no problems with shipping or delivery besides that it is at a lower price than the rest i highly recommend it especially for people like me who are building their first gamer and work pc and are looking piece by piece,Positive,Positive
0.0,0.708,0.292,0.908,amazing cpu previously had a i f so for me it was an extreme upgrade extra more stable fps in pretty much all my games can also tune with intel xtu which is a good feature to have,Positive,Positive
0.209,0.742,0.05,-0.9331,its very fast but it heats up a lot it even uses w in a stress test before buying try to find out on the forums about this issue no matter what cooler and thermal paste you use it will get very hot the only solution is to make a slight undervolt or lower the loadline calibration in the bios it reminded me of the ik that suffered from the same problem,Negative,Negative
0.0,0.818,0.182,0.955,with intel its very good the performance is just incredible with the native boost i managed to oc up to ghz and im sure that we can go up again with a custom water the only flaw is that very quickly when you take a  he sticks his tongue out a bit in k i will have to change it after  years because of bottleneck but on a configuration with a  ti it must be a very good synergy very good on processor tasks too to use it to do a bit of rendering the performance is really good,Positive,Positive
0.043,0.845,0.112,0.9954,i upgraded to this cpu after some heavy research asking reddit both intel and amd subreddits weighing in money vs performance gained i have used amd since i was a teen and started building computers the conclusion is this it is an amazing cpu runs faster and cooler than my ryzen   the price and performance vs amd also including a board was better than if i had went with a ryzen  xsome background information i wanted to upgrade after receiving an amazon gift card i have never ordered computer parts from amazon though i upgraded from a ryzen   with an asus xf board i really wanted to upgrade and was sad also that windows  did not support my cpu i will give it to microsoft for this as it made a lot of people upgrade their entire computers all for basically the same os as of now with newer looks and not much done under the hood except for th gen intel so good news there too sadly my old board still doesnt support the ryzen   series and only the  series they are working on a bios apparently for the  series because of people who were in my shoes i first almost ordered the ryzen  xt for  after a couple hours of research asking and thinking about it i cancelled that order thankfully and thought well if i am going to spend this much on upgrading my cpu i might as well go all inspend a little more for something better as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile i was then going to get the ryzen  x with an asus board there lied a problem of price i could not find a board and get that cpu still within my budget atleast not a board that wasnt worse than the one i had in ways i mentioned i had posted on the amd subreddit and even they suggested i go intel intel is just killing it as of now hands down although i am sure amd will retaliate i ended up getting the msi za ddr i wish i had the money for ddr ram i would have went with the ddr version as it was basically the same price i had a lot of second thoughts on this board though as it just didnt seem premium as the one i had i am going to do a whole review on it after this ill save my pros  cons for there this cpu also autoclocks itself up or down depending on the load saw it clock down to ghz although not for long for example if not much processing power is warranted which makes sense and i wish everything did so if idling it will clock down and save powerheatand therefore longevity is increased i absolutely love this cpu coming from amd anywaysif you have a corsair hi rgb platinum or similar cooler already the included  screws work just fine with the  socket and this cpu even though you are supposed to get the  kitscrews for this cpu which i did but they are taking forever to ship so i googled and someone said using the  screws will work just fine i get better temps than my ryzen   i can even overclock even more but have no need and no pointtldrupgraded from ryzen   asus rog strix xf gamingupgraded to ik msi za ddrparts kept xgb gb ddr cl mhz ram with xmp docp rtx  the ram works great with this cpu as well although it technically latency wise runs at t on intel instead of t on amd runs slower than when on amd amds infinity fabric but obviously whatever intel is doing makes up for that and therefore my ram either runs fasterthe samepros it is an amazing cpu for price vs performance the ik is good as well i almost just went with it and you would be fine going with it for gaming as even it still has more cores technically than the ryzen  x it also beats the x even though this cpu is supposed to be its comparison rival brother this cpu has cool temps on my corsair hi rgb platinum cooler and the pe core structure are really cool and fun to watch when doing tasksgaming it shipped fastcons literally none with the cpu itself just with shipping  it shipped really fast was here in  days after purchasing on here the biggest complaint i have is amazons shipping so be aware of this i have never ordered computer parts from amazon and have always used newegg they just left the cpu in my mailbox and if it werent for me looking at my cameras and looking out for this part it would have sat in the mailbox all day my mailbox sadly is not very weather proof as well and if it had been raining it wouldnt have been good although it did come in a big box around it the cpu also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box not held into the front windowi hope this review helps people,Positive,Positive

0.04,0.879,0.081,0.3781,the ik is in the top  for gaming cpus right now amd is doing fairly well as of late but intel has a solid performance lead with its single core performance on newer generation chipsif youre on the fence and want a quick top  for overall gaming performance it goes as follows ik ik ik ik ikthis chip is no slouch though it trades blows with the k in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isnt really fair for comparisonin conclusion if youre looking around this price point check both this cpu and the k pick whichever is cheaper higher end th gen intel motherboards can be flashed in the bios to take th gen cpus too but do your research on those before going that route this one will serve you well,Positive,Positive

0.126,0.709,0.165,0.6424,this is my first upgrade since the ik this processor is a beast eats away at any task i throw at it without a sweat i was a little hesitant with the new cpu designs with the performance and efficiency cores but man the efficiency cores alone kill my k  great cpu just make sure you know these shoot to the sky heat wise when you punch heavy workloads and you will need cooling to match depending of how long and how much you will need to pull away from it,Positive,Positive
0.062,0.791,0.147,0.5994,the processor arrived in optimal condition in a timely manner ill update the review once ive properly installed and tested it for the time being i can only comment on the seller who actually shipped in the best and expeditious way,Positive,Positive
0.039,0.777,0.184,0.8571,ikit was originally a replacement from the th generation ik performance has been greatly improved im very satisfied  a lot of streaming software etc have been started at the same time but so far there is no such thing as insufficient processing performance however its easy to hold the heat i dont know if air cooling can cool it down i use simple water cooling fyi,Positive,Positive
0.086,0.799,0.115,0.8535,i was worried about the top model core ik but i chose this core ik which has the same specs as the number of cores and improved peak performance and watt performance it is operated with a z motherboard but if the bios is compatible there is no particular problem since recent motherboards only need a power supply to update the bios there are many cases where there is no problem even if the bios is not compatible we recommend that you update your device drivers to the latest or download if you are installing a new one beforehand the score of cinebenchr is  in multi and  in single the score has increased by about  from the core ik and the power consumption during full load is about w lower so its a nice feeling compared to nm and current products from other companies i think they are doing well with process rules that are  to  generations down but i think that the evaluation is divided without changing from alder lake that a mm simple watercooled cooler is essential performance per watt at full load is honestly quite subtle the one i installed this time is for a gaming pc so im personally very satisfied because it doesnt let me encode videos if it is the main encoding process i recommend the ryzen  x which is an old model that works without problems with a large air cooled cooler but is easy to handle and is cheaper if youre a game main i recommend the core ik which has high singlethread performance because it has high watt performance and cost performance,Positive,Positive
0.044,0.875,0.082,0.4404,this is a great cpu periodhowever get a thermalright contact plate to replace your mobos socket clamp this is a must have item to keep your cpu flat to make proper contact with your cooler its a  dollar part installs in seconds and can lower your temps c easythank me later,Positive,Positive

0.031,0.811,0.158,0.987,after too many years of gaming on an old ik i finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year  i purchased the most up to date cpu and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did overall i think this is a great cpu however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things intel just keeps pushing these cpus harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of amd but in the process they are making cpus that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool after a lot of tweaking in the bios i finally got this one to stay below the  degree celsius threshold but that doesnt account for how hot it still makes my room when im gaming the extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months but as summer is approaching im wondering how this is going to pan outanyway the cpu is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box i didnt run into any errors or issues with this cpu overall i  recommend it because intel has never let me down ive been building my own systems for more than  years now too so thats a pretty long track record of cpus that just worked and never died because of that i can easily recommend this cpu and i would definitely order it again,Positive,Positive

0.077,0.822,0.101,0.7371,the cpu is overall great for everything itll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming if you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy but the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler first of all i would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnt and also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting also the performance is not nice many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so i took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95degrees and it was approx the same case while gaming idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling so be careful with the stock cooler or i would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like india where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you dont have an ac in your room aio is the choice,Positive,Positive

0.029,0.947,0.024,-0.8466,introcome  giusto che sia anzich comprare portatilini e preassemblati un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo e oltre a questo condivide la sua esperienza nellantica arte del pc building anche con amici e parenti mio fratello aveva necessit? di utilizzare un computer e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un mac ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura e comunque quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al pc gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraternoho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perch trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico  gaming e con un budget relativamente limitato ok lamore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualit? alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400f ma io volevo il 12400 quindi ho fatto il reso e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque  identico a parte la gpu integrata e frequenze un pelino pi alte quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processoresi tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread che non ha i fantomatici ecores delle serie pi costose per sempio il 12600 ha 6pcore come questo pi 4ecore che aiutano nelle operazioni in background specialmente se usate windows 11 a una frequenza di 25 ghz con un boost fino a 44ghz se le temperature il workload e la vostra scheda madre lo permettonoun processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni pi complicate infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con adobe premierelho abbinato a una rtx3060 12g della gigabyte e a 32gb di ddr4 a 3200mhz il tutto su una asus b660ma primeperformance e temperaturecome dicevo prima si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni pi professionali larchitettura di questi processori intel di dodicesima generazione dopo unundicesima generazione abbastanza deludente  eccellentesenza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio ryzen 5 5600x senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttivit? utilizzando questo processore ammesso che il resto dellhardware sia allaltezzaio lo utilizzo con delle banali ddr4 a 3200mhz quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600x che avevo su una mia build dellanno scorso se invece lo abbinate a delle ddr5 un po serie pu sicuramente superarlo anche se di pocoin ogni caso nel gaming si comporta benissimo specialmente se abbinato ad una gpu un po seria come la mia rtx3060 non ho notato colli di bottiglia specialmente nel caso di questa build che sar? usata con un monitor solo 1080pper quanto riguarda le temperature si tratta di una cpu abbastanza tranquilla con un tdp di solo 65w al momento non ho un dissipatore perch non mi  arrivato quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione mi aspettavo facesse pena invece  decisamente accettabile le temperature non superano i 70c in gaming anche con giochi pesanti mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un cinebench non supera gli 80c che  accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100c anche il rumore della ventolina originale  abbastanza contenuto quindi boh magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock sicuramente comunque il mio case un nzxt con 4 ventole aggiuntive aiuta non poco oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata e ci ho messo la mia fidata gelid gc extreme perch per un processore da 65w con il dissi stock sicuramente  necessaria una pasta termica di livello extremeversione f o non f tray o box gpu integratala differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilit? della gpu integrata la versione f non la include e generalmente costa un po meno a seconda della differenza di prezzo valutate se prendere una o laltra io non sono un fan delle gpu integrate intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una gpu dedicata anche se scarsissima in questo caso ho la rtx3060 che  una buona scheda da gaming quindi perch ho voluto prendere il processore con la gpu integrata perch con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia intel quicksync la gpu integrata non sta l a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per lencoding video o per altre operazioni come per esempio la timeline in premiere il fratellino utilizza adobe premiere che pu sfruttare questa tecnologia ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano come per esempio obs studio che pu sfruttare lencoder video della gpu integrata per strimmare lasciando libera la gpu dedicata per il giocoin ogni caso la gpu integrata  la solita intel uhd sul 12400  la uhd 730 sul 12500 la 770 non lho testata molto nel gaming ma comunque non aspettatevi chiss? cosa la potenza di questa  simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930m o gi di l quindi va bene per giochi leggeri in ogni caso non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3d non particolarmente complesse regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori variper quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche a volte vediamo tray o box la differenza tra le due  la presenza del dissipatore nella versione box come dicevo sopra il dissipatore  scarso ma per una cpu come questa  sufficiente se invece il dissi non vi serve prendete la versione trayprendo il 12400 12500 o 12600secondo me tra questi tre il migliore  il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perchil 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli mentre il 12600  a tutti gli effetti il modello superiorepartiamo dal 12500 questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco pi alte oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente pi potente ovvero la intel uhd 770 contro la 730 del 12400 le frequenze pi alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5 di pi o di meno a seconda del workload ma praticamente mai sopra il 10 la gpu integrata  di poco pi potente ma si tratta sempre di unintegrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100 in pi evitatelo io lho comprato solo perch mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400f anzich il 12400 altrimenti non lavrei mai compratoil 12600 invece  su un altro campo da gioco ed  a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore come dicevo allinizio oltre ai 6 pcore il 12600 ha 4 ecore oltre che frequenze pi alte e la versione k se volete overcloccare per il prezzo di quasi 150 sopra al 12400 potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering nel gaming sono praticamente uguali la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse in giochi aaa magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla gpu nella maggior parte dei casi in ogni caso se si vuole assemblare un pc con un budget pi alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una gpu pi potente della mia 3060 potrebbe valerne la pena anche solo per la presenza degli ecorescomunque ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot da considerare per qualunque pc di fascia media valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezziconclusioneche dire il 12400  una cpu di tutto rispetto ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra laltro  eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media abbinato ad una gpu un po seria e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolasticosicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto,Negative,Negative

0.037,0.786,0.177,0.9965,so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi biosin gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive gamesupdatei have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset  if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less powerif youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht onthe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imccore wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen,Positive,Positive
0.055,0.823,0.123,0.9825,so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw  for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great,Positive,Positive
0.164,0.754,0.082,-0.9724,i have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal  i originally purchased the i9 13900k did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that i stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card  i didnt refund as i assumed that i had done the damage  literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before i realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate  yet again assuming that i must have done something wrong i ordered this replacement chip to find issues suddenly occuring again  this is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollarsim an it professional have been in the industry for more than 20 years and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumeri really hate to say it i hold stocks in intel ive loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice i can no longer say thisi honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and its predecessori had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before i could even lock down this issuei hate to say it but if id gone with a competitor i would have saved multiple thousands of dollars,Negative,Negative

0.082,0.881,0.036,-0.9527,i decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didnt justify the price difference considering i was already getting about 13 more performance than my 12th generation i9 i wanted plenty of motherboard resources so i also bought the msi meg z790 ace 32 gb of kingston fury 6400mts ddr5 and a 2tb samsung 990 nvme drivecooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9 even with a 360mm aio cooler so i went custom loop along the way i found a gpu water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling the thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators but i wanted some disks so i went for a 560x140 and a 280x140 both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans four more fans feed air into the case and theres till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged inso whats the result the processor runs at 85c worst case and only two cores at that temperature the fast ddr5 does make a significant difference i initially ran it at 6gts then turned it up to 62 and finally 64 the last change is a 35 change in ddr5 speed and that gave me a 24 increase in system speed i kept my old rtx3070 which used to run over 80c and now runs at 62c worst case so despite more performance the system runs a lot cooleri mostly run xplane 12 which runs the gpu and cpu very hard continuously after several hours the cooling water reached 36c and the worst core temperature was 85c the processor just works no stability issues with the standard settings on the msi z690 motherboard there are three standard memory tuning options for 60 62 and 64 gts and all work this will do for me for a few years,Negative,Negative

0.064,0.814,0.122,0.8876,compared to the coffee lake generation i had been willingly stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap before buying i was a bit skeptical since im not a fan of intels newer way of handling cores but the first thing i tried when i got it was emulating ps3 games and right off the bat i saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubledthe older cpus from the 8th 9th and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if youre on a budget maybe look on the used market for those but if you really need something powerful this is a good option,Positive,Positive

0.0,0.859,0.141,0.869,at this time in the product life cycle the 12th gen cpu is about half the cost of the 14th gen cpu  it is more than fast enough for everything i do  my major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have tpm 20  the cpu was easy to install it is running between 3637 degrees celsius though i admit i am not stressing it  i am very happy with my purchase,Positive,Positive

0.031,0.793,0.175,0.7783,wow what an incredible black friday deal seriously 211 is well worth it for the performance i also purchased the 12600k for 153 which is another unbeatable deal offered this year at amazon if you managed to get your hands on either one of you made the right choice,Positive,Positive
0.0,0.494,0.506,0.6249,great cpu would buy again,Positive,Positive
0.053,0.816,0.131,0.9132,its pretty good value for money as far as intel cpus are concerned for a 12th gen cpu but if youre looking for the better value get the i513600k which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen cpu the only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard otherwise youll need to flash the bios on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen cpu i highly do not recommend doing this ive tried it a few and its such a big hassle many potential issuesthat i recommend first time pc builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen cpu along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard dont buy 12th gen mobo which obviously doesnt require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable,Positive,Positive

0.077,0.776,0.146,0.6259,for my limited budget i bought it while the 12700k isnt the top of the line at least for me it was more affordable and very performant ive had good success overclocking it and actually undervolting  it to reduce temperatures,Positive,Positive
0.102,0.814,0.084,-0.2534,so far so good but then thats what i said about the last one  ill check back in a year on this and hope it outlasts my prior cpuas for the last one its intel dropping the ball with their qc it seems  had an imc function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed  couldnt run any xmp profiles and swapping the processor solved it not a mobo issuejust watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen and return it if anything seems even remotely off,Negative,Negative

0.0,0.93,0.07,0.3818,not much to say about this cpu its intel and these are immortal still have the 3770k i got like 10 years ago and an extreme i got even earlier than thatso the main motive here is to let amazon know that i have received the item but i dont know how to let them know so they can change the package left at mail to already received,Positive,Positive

0.0,0.899,0.101,0.7808,bought this k to have graphics backup the cpu is great the graphics not so much still i do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my pc but only for the purpose of having temporary backup when needed so for that purpose it works the cost vs the kf is fairly negligible so for its primary purpose it is a very good cpu,Positive,Positive
0.04,0.88,0.08,0.3781,the i712700k is in the top 5 for gaming cpus right now amd is doing fairly well as of late but intel has a solid performance lead with its single core performance on newer generation chipsif youre on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance it goes as follows1 i913900k2 i713700k3 i912900k4 i513600k5 i712700kthis chip is no slouch though it trades blows with the 13600k in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isnt really fair for comparisonin conclusion if youre looking around this price point check both this cpu and the 13600k pick whichever is cheaper higher end 12th gen intel motherboards can be flashed in the bios to take 13th gen cpus too but do your research on those before going that route this one will serve you well,Positive,Positive

0.044,0.849,0.106,0.8373,its been roughly 67 years since i last build my gaming computer upgrading to this has been more than significant as of this writing i hope youve done your research the i712700ks price point and its competition for this price point it may be the top dogsome things to consider before purchasing1 make sure you are purchasing a lga 1700 motherboard i went with the ddr4 motherboard because ddr5 is still at its infancy the ddr5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now youll be fine with ddr42 this cpu does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor double check if your psu will be enough there are online resources that will help you calculate your psu its always good to have a little overhead3 make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws thats compatible with this motherboard you can purchase them separately if you have a heatsink thats very old 2016 its more than likely it may not be compatiblegood luck,Positive,Positive
0.068,0.803,0.129,0.8462,i had been planning to hold off for raptor lake but my z370 mobo died and i decided to go ahead and get an alder lake i7  so far its impressive  it runs much cooler than my i99900k mild oc  59c63c under a gaming load vs 75c but that couldve been due to the my old aio being in its death throws for the past few months  3dmark cpu score went up noticeably as well  overall im pretty happy with it  havent messed around with overclocking yet but there doesnt seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be  from what ive read 53 ghz is about what you can expect  the days of getting another 800mhz  1 ghz  over stock clocks out of a cpu are gone it seems,Positive,Positive

0.037,0.786,0.177,0.9965,so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi biosin gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive gamesupdatei have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset  if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less powerif youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht onthe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imccore wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen,Positive,Positive
0.055,0.823,0.123,0.9825,so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw  for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great,Positive,Positive
0.164,0.754,0.082,-0.9724,i have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal  i originally purchased the i9 13900k did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that i stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card  i didnt refund as i assumed that i had done the damage  literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before i realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate  yet again assuming that i must have done something wrong i ordered this replacement chip to find issues suddenly occuring again  this is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollarsim an it professional have been in the industry for more than 20 years and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumeri really hate to say it i hold stocks in intel ive loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice i can no longer say thisi honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and its predecessori had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before i could even lock down this issuei hate to say it but if id gone with a competitor i would have saved multiple thousands of dollars,Negative,Negative

0.033,0.892,0.075,0.6148,before you purchase this cpu please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 aio as well this cpu is in need of it im not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm in my asus bios i turned on disabledenforce all limits so that the motherboard doesnt try to do on the fly oc to keep temps low and stability up i havent had any crashes or stability issues at all i did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this i kept my rtx 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable id say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my lian li galahad ii trinity 360 its a monster of a cpu genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade dont hesitate you wont regret it,Positive,Positive
0.082,0.881,0.036,-0.9527,i decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didnt justify the price difference considering i was already getting about 13 more performance than my 12th generation i9 i wanted plenty of motherboard resources so i also bought the msi meg z790 ace 32 gb of kingston fury 6400mts ddr5 and a 2tb samsung 990 nvme drivecooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9 even with a 360mm aio cooler so i went custom loop along the way i found a gpu water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling the thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators but i wanted some disks so i went for a 560x140 and a 280x140 both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans four more fans feed air into the case and theres till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged inso whats the result the processor runs at 85c worst case and only two cores at that temperature the fast ddr5 does make a significant difference i initially ran it at 6gts then turned it up to 62 and finally 64 the last change is a 35 change in ddr5 speed and that gave me a 24 increase in system speed i kept my old rtx3070 which used to run over 80c and now runs at 62c worst case so despite more performance the system runs a lot cooleri mostly run xplane 12 which runs the gpu and cpu very hard continuously after several hours the cooling water reached 36c and the worst core temperature was 85c the processor just works no stability issues with the standard settings on the msi z690 motherboard there are three standard memory tuning options for 60 62 and 64 gts and all work this will do for me for a few years,Negative,Negative

0.037,0.786,0.177,0.9965,so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi biosin gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive gamesupdatei have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset  if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less powerif youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht onthe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imccore wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen,Positive,Positive
0.055,0.823,0.123,0.9825,so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw  for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great,Positive,Positive

0.082,0.881,0.036,-0.9527,i decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didnt justify the price difference considering i was already getting about 13 more performance than my 12th generation i9 i wanted plenty of motherboard resources so i also bought the msi meg z790 ace 32 gb of kingston fury 6400mts ddr5 and a 2tb samsung 990 nvme drivecooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9 even with a 360mm aio cooler so i went custom loop along the way i found a gpu water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling the thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators but i wanted some disks so i went for a 560x140 and a 280x140 both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans four more fans feed air into the case and theres till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged inso whats the result the processor runs at 85c worst case and only two cores at that temperature the fast ddr5 does make a significant difference i initially ran it at 6gts then turned it up to 62 and finally 64 the last change is a 35 change in ddr5 speed and that gave me a 24 increase in system speed i kept my old rtx3070 which used to run over 80c and now runs at 62c worst case so despite more performance the system runs a lot cooleri mostly run xplane 12 which runs the gpu and cpu very hard continuously after several hours the cooling water reached 36c and the worst core temperature was 85c the processor just works no stability issues with the standard settings on the msi z690 motherboard there are three standard memory tuning options for 60 62 and 64 gts and all work this will do for me for a few years,Negative,Negative

0.019,0.92,0.061,0.8855,this isnt the processor for everyone but it is very fast the individual cores arent significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7 but if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you i do software development which it doesnt help 99 of the time gaming which it helps a little and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music during transcoding it helps a huge amount i have over 300gb of flac audio files that i ripped from my cd collection i never buy mp3s i wanted to have that on my phone but i didnt want to carry it at full rate because i cant tell the difference in the car so i transcoded it i had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old ryzen 7 this machine took around 30 minutes 3040 times faster at work the optics team which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses uses i9s in preference to xeons the xeons might be faster under some circumstances but the machines are hugely expensive so the i9s are much better for price performance would i buy it again id probably buy the 13th generation but if i had any sense id just get the 13th gen i7,Positive,Positive
0.077,0.682,0.241,0.7717,make sure you have a good aio  not an msi core liquid v2 360 because that one died on me and this was seeing 8090c idle other than that this processor is pretty good when its cooled properly,Positive,Positive

0.042,0.808,0.151,0.9804,this thing never goes over 15 percent usage and most games its actually using 04 percent even on escape from tarkov at max settings 4k 140 fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 01 percent i dont know if its my computer reading an error but i use a few apps to check including the task manager tab i use an nzxt aio and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when im gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s i tried wow classic retail  cyberpunk spiderman  and regularly play escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage my gpu barely works as i have a 3090 ti my gpu is usually at usage 4050 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool so i dont think anything is bottle neckingmy old computer has an i5 and i have a laptop with an i7 and when i am gaming they are usually at 90 percent usage even my friend with the amd 5800x3d was getting at least 30percent usage for aaa games this is the first computer ive built where im actually not even worried about the cpu for how cool it runs im really shocked on how good its performance is definitely recommend,Positive,Positive
0.05,0.869,0.081,0.7239,purchased this cpu to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that i have had for close to 4 years now and considering i also own a 3090 i was lucky enough to get last year it was time paired with said gpu and a msi tomahawk z690 with a noctua nhd15 chromax black cooler this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like discord would introduce very bad stutter however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k temps are high when im doing full resolution photo renders from my dji air 2s or sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking but that is expected and im not one to sweat about 8090c temps but if you are i would recommend the 12700k5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage however in gaming with multiple different firefox tabs and discordtelegram open it never even touches 70c so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well as my system can suck north of 600750w full tilt my power supply being a 1200w platinum evga that doesnt break a sweat under full load,Positive,Positive

0.026,0.919,0.055,0.7991,so far this thing is great i upgraded from the 9900k and this has been a noticeable difference im still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software i havent done any overclocking so the cinebench score and temps are straight stock settingsafter seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get i added the thermalright contact frame it was a breeze to install i watched the gamers nexus video about this frame and followed their directionsfor the motherboard i went with a msi z690 mpg edge wifi ddr4 so i could reuse my current ram i had to order a lga 1700 bracket for the nzxt kraken x73 aio i ordered both the frame and the lga 1700 mount from amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what i neededso far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900k im planning to do a little gaming this week with it so ill have a chance to see how it does under my daily use i also do a bit of premiere and after effects so im looking forward to seeing how it works there as welloverall this is probably way more processor than i need i was still able to do what i needed to do with the 9900k i built the 9900k in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high pc price wave i ended up getting this processor for about 100 less than i paid for the 9900k two years ago so the pricetoperformance upgrade for me was a no brainerif you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price this is a great one to get just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling,Positive,Positive

0.062,0.809,0.129,0.8201,are usually go for the best products and it was a mistake for my first pc build i chose this chip and i didnt know it runs that hot i built my pc i had enough fans but i had a 240 mm radiator i want a micro center and had to get a 360 mm cooler from the pool the temps were at 89 to 92c after the deep cool aio under stress test and bench testing the temp stay under 60c  other than that i game hard on it and stream and the cpu usage never goes past 30 its pretty overkill but thats how i like my pc,Positive,Positive

0.047,0.829,0.124,0.9142,i bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores there is a price difference to consider as many know more cores doesnt necessarily mean better games only use a max of 6 cores though it may vary from game to game if you just want to game buy the i7 series my 4790k had served me so well its still my backup on my old mobo its been at least 5 years since i bought ol reliable shes been through rough seas it was time for her to rest easyfor the i9 in terms of gaming performance only cpu heavy games like rts games will see any benefit multitasking also sees benefit though thats limited to the hard drive its working off of still i expect great things in the far futurethe packaging is a keeper to be sure too,Positive,Positive

0.014,0.916,0.07,0.6983,the 12900k can be hard to justify the 12700k is around twothirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent furthermore you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more even while using the nhd15 cpu cooler i decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k given the option to do it over i would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about 250,Positive,Positive

0.066,0.864,0.07,-0.4118,so first things first this is a genuinely powerful cpu thats been able to handle basically every task that ive thrown at it it runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with easenow with that out of the way thermals this thing gets hot and i mean really hot if youre going with air cooling i strongly recommend a double tower sixeight pipe air cooler like the corsair a115 or a cooler master ma824 if you are going the aio route anything less than a 360mm aio will under perform for that go with any 360mm aio from any brand of your choice if you have the space go with a 420mm aio for the best resultsfinally there has been recent reports of cpu degradation and instability when using this cpu i am using this with an asus rog strix z790h motherboard and it basically juiced the cpu like no tomorrow until i applied intels power settings for this cpu this likely is the cause of the degradation be sure to check intels website for recommended power settings also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k cpu out of intels specificationsin conclusion heres my personal experience the cpu functions but i can not use asus ai overclocking feature as i get a bsod with the clockwatchdogtimeout error and apps will randomly crash you probably shouldnt use any ai assisted overclocking feature if you can help it even running this at stock there is still a substantial amount of performance in this cpu if you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your cpu i would just wait for meteorlake or just go with amdfinal note i am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my cpu,Negative,Negative
0.033,0.8,0.167,0.9474,i initially got a 13700k but grabbed this after and snubbed the 14 gen i upgraded from 8700k which is still a very capable cpu even today but due to the demands of certain programs the 13900k is handling them better than the 13700k so farfingers crossed to hoping it will not fail in future there are well documented power issues that intel and their partners have with the 13th 14th gen may be an upsell to the upcoming ultra line of cpusso you have to take this into account and modify your motherboards bios and follow intels suggested settingsi will update this review if anything else comes up,Positive,Positive
0.045,0.874,0.082,0.6542,we set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday  to make a long story short we liked how fast this ran compared to the i711th gen we had from beforethe surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others  we hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the cpus and was shocked that this one was drawing 450w as others were showing  200w  and temperature went up to 100c while the others were at 70cone system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy it would reboot  we determined the problem was that psu only supported 12v rail at 20a  we switched to a 600w psu that supports 12v 50a and it worked flawlessly  so watch out that your psu supplies sufficient amps at 12vordered a replacement replacement brand new would not boot up  we swapped back old cpu from and it boots up but runs hot again  this one we had to reduce workload to 75 of other systems to cool it downso 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  this is a huge surprise  these systems had no gpu only motherboard 64gb of ddr5 and an ssd  has anyone else seen this,Positive,Positive

0.018,0.816,0.167,0.9935,i got this and a new ddr5 motherboard with z690 chipset  it didnt boot when i set it all up  it turns out the z690 needs a bios update to work with this cpu  luckily i had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard  i dropped it in and it booted then i did the bios update  after that it boots this cpu just finebefore this i was a diehard amd supporter  i had 5950x with 16 cores 32 threads and 72mb of cache  but it just doesnt compete with this i9  i havent tried the 7950x but i read that the pcores just blow away the amd cores  even with less cache  the setup of 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores just works  it stays much cooler than earlier i9s and the amd  i use a water cooler but its not required  nothing slows this down when paired with ddr5i wish the amd was better i like the company more  but i want the best of the best and as of today there is nothing better than this available  if you game or do graphics or anything on your pc this is the cpu for you  it will not disappointa word on the x790 chipset  you would think they will have better performance because they are newer  they dont  they will work with the i9 no matter what while the z690 might need a bios update  they have one more usb port  but otherwise there is no benefit to getting z790 and they cost a lot more  so if you have the ability to use an older cpu to flash the bios or find one that is new enough that it doesnt need the update this cpu will be great,Positive,Positive
0.114,0.675,0.211,0.8644,this cpu unit is a beast upgraded from a i7 8700kthe improvement was huge doubled my fps in wow and there is no more lag nevertheless after 6 months of regular use it started failingmany kernel errors until it finally became useless i could somehow return it to intel from per to usa great support outside usbut such a complex and expensive unit cannot fail that quickly without heavy usage at least in my opinion,Positive,Positive
0.0,0.91,0.09,0.9117,i really like this cpu and it has worked well for my needs many had the issue of overheating throttling and even bending in some instances i have not experienced any of this since i knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the bios to keep this monster cpu running cool it seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues all you need to to is look up the specs for your cpu and setup the bios of your motherboard accordinglyi am using the aorus waterforce x 280 with artic mx6 thermal paste just in case you are curious this has also been installed on the gigabyte z790 aorus elite ax motherboardas long as you set this up correctly you will not have any issues and will get a great performing cpu,Positive,Positive
0.056,0.811,0.132,0.7684,like the title says and all the reviews say this thing is a beast  make sure you have a good cooling solution lined up  even without overclocking this puppy will handle anything ive thrown at it with ease  but like all the reviews you see online say it puts out some serious heat  ive had it for about 45months now before it started cooling off outside i was have to crank the ac to keep my gaming room cool and now that its cooling off outside 3040 f at night i have blocked off the vents in the room to prevent any additional heat  this thing paired with a rtx 4090 keeps this room plenty warm enough for me  so on the plus side ill be saving on heating this winter,Positive,Positive

0.0,0.959,0.041,0.3612,i did end up returning it because of a motherboard issue i do have a 12900k and many other types and they all perform as expected i would recommend intel processors to those looking for something for general all around performance as the 14900k and 13900k are basically the same i would say get this one unless you can find the 14900k for the same price,Positive,Positive
0.061,0.786,0.154,0.9644,this processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card i can edit videos and play games both at 4k settings together no problem and it doesnt generate that much heat either i previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4k so sadly i had to retire my old build just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090 dont be a smartass and try to put it in small case you will regret it later i personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you dont want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent good luck gamers and editors just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor amd processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do,Positive,Positive

0.059,0.762,0.179,0.974,its so good and that makes sense since its top of the line right now imagine that going from my 9900k to this was like a spiritual enlightening but also i must add this is totally unnecessary unless youll be working with heavy loads unreal engine 4k video editing and streaming 4k gaming or anything that requires overclockingbuying this bad boy will future proof your computer for now but there are very few people who need this kind of cpu if youre shopping for your build right now and considering this if its in the budget and you want something thatll handle literally whatever you want then yes this is great but just remember whatever you want might not be as intense as this thing accounts fornow that ive warned you about not needing this let me just say how happy i am that i got it i do a lot of 4k editing and streaming and there is no issue runs smoothly and efficiently does get hot though if youve got a good cooler on this then youll be good to go for a long time,Positive,Positive
0.057,0.836,0.107,0.7906,i bought two of these from amazon after one from another vendor failed to post  both worked the first time  do you need 24 cores for games  most games use 4 or 6 cores max so probably not  video editing can benefit from the extra cores  intel supports xmp extreme memory profile and this processor is unlocked it can be overclocked  overclocking increases the power consumption and heat therefore one needs a robust cooling solution  overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the intel extreme tuning utility  i have the nzxt kraken x 73 rgb liquid cooler  with the nzxt cam software you can see the cpu and gpu temperatures and control the fan speeds reducing the risk of damaging the processor  while idling at 55 ghz the cpu temperature is 30 c  under a 50 load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 c  pros good for video editing cons a bit pricey for a gaming computer  dont overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 c,Positive,Positive

0.026,0.91,0.063,0.7184,excellent processor it is a beast in gaming and in productivity for the price i believe is unrivaled beware that you should separately buy a cpu cooler because it does not come with onealso beware that most motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the bios so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit for example im using an 360mm aio cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my aorus elite ax when running cinebench it reaches 100c within 12 seconds of starting of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games there the max ive seen the cpu get is 67c but is something to be aware ofall in all happy with this beast,Positive,Positive

0.037,0.786,0.177,0.9965,so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks 6ghz on two cores and 57ghz on all cores unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with 60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi biosin gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 57ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive gamesupdatei have the cpu now at 58ghz with ht disabled and a 75mv offset and its working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 58ghz which is amazing since its on an air cooled setup though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps they are a little lower than running it at 57ghz with ht enabled and a 50mv offset  if i use a 75mv offset with 58ghz and ht enabled my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less powerif youre predominantly using your machine for gaming then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if youre using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming then definitely turn ht onthe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isnt as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 135v on the imc but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 141v which just isnt worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 136v on the imccore wise though the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen,Positive,Positive
0.055,0.823,0.123,0.9825,so i finally upgraded my home workstation and went to this new i914900k it is incredibly fast i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup the i76850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render on the new i9 the exact same file was re exported took just over 8 minutes almost a 3x speed increase also when you speed up footage in resolve the old cpu could not play it back smoothly it would jump and chug like crazy the new i9 it plays it back sped up 800 no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly applications open u p much faster too but that could be more due to the pcie40 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build the one thing i do not like about the new cpu is the number of pci lanes you only get 20 16 are pcie50 and 4 are pcie40 this wont be an issue for most people but my old cpu had 40 lanes allowing me to run 3 gpus at the same time and yes i needed them i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpus in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims with this new cpu i can only run 2 gpus and they run at 8x cause they share the 16x and that does leave me 4 full pcie40 lanes for the system drive it is not a deal breaker and the increased speed overall is well worth it one thing everybody should be aware of is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores something my old cpu did not have ecores can severely impact certain software performance when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw  for the first time i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost and the software was literally almost unusable the ecores were slowing the software down so bad i could barely change settings in the preferences it was that bad i had to install process lasso  fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it  and disable the use of ecores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great,Positive,Positive
0.164,0.754,0.082,-0.9724,i have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal  i originally purchased the i9 13900k did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that i stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card  i didnt refund as i assumed that i had done the damage  literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before i realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate  yet again assuming that i must have done something wrong i ordered this replacement chip to find issues suddenly occuring again  this is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollarsim an it professional have been in the industry for more than 20 years and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumeri really hate to say it i hold stocks in intel ive loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice i can no longer say thisi honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and its predecessori had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before i could even lock down this issuei hate to say it but if id gone with a competitor i would have saved multiple thousands of dollars,Negative,Negative

0.082,0.881,0.036,-0.9527,i decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didnt justify the price difference considering i was already getting about 13 more performance than my 12th generation i9 i wanted plenty of motherboard resources so i also bought the msi meg z790 ace 32 gb of kingston fury 6400mts ddr5 and a 2tb samsung 990 nvme drivecooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9 even with a 360mm aio cooler so i went custom loop along the way i found a gpu water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling the thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators but i wanted some disks so i went for a 560x140 and a 280x140 both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans four more fans feed air into the case and theres till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged inso whats the result the processor runs at 85c worst case and only two cores at that temperature the fast ddr5 does make a significant difference i initially ran it at 6gts then turned it up to 62 and finally 64 the last change is a 35 change in ddr5 speed and that gave me a 24 increase in system speed i kept my old rtx3070 which used to run over 80c and now runs at 62c worst case so despite more performance the system runs a lot cooleri mostly run xplane 12 which runs the gpu and cpu very hard continuously after several hours the cooling water reached 36c and the worst core temperature was 85c the processor just works no stability issues with the standard settings on the msi z690 motherboard there are three standard memory tuning options for 60 62 and 64 gts and all work this will do for me for a few years,Negative,Negative
